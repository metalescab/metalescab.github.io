In the Metals Physics Division, mechanical testing and microstructural characterization services are regularly performed for research groups of the institution itself, other institutions and companies. In this area, the support to CNEA priority projects (CAREM, RA 10) through specific Service Agreements that include advice as well as the implementation of experimental activities related to mechanical characterization (e.g. fretting, fracture, fatigue tests) and microstructural characterization (e.g. transmission electron microscopy) stand out. In addition, mechanical tests are developed and carried out for other companies, mainly INVAP, all of which are channeled through contracts within the Technological Innovation Law NÂº 23.877.

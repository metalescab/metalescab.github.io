Julio graduated with a degree in Chemistry in 2009 from the [Faculty of Exact Sciences](https://www.exactas.unlp.edu.ar/) at the [National University of La Plata](https://www.unlp.edu.ar/), in the city of La Plata, Buenos Aires province, Argentina. As a doctoral fellow of [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar), he obtained his PhD in Chemistry from the same faculty in 2014, conducting his thesis work at the [Laboratory of Nanoscopies and Surface Physical Chemistry](https://nano.quimica.unlp.edu.ar/) of the [Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physicochemical Research (INIFTA)](https://www.inifta.unlp.edu.ar/), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Mariano H. Fonticelli and co-supervision of Dr. Elizabeth Jares-Erijman from the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). His thesis titled ["Study on the Modification of Metallic Nanoparticles for the Development of Photomodulable Fluorescent Sensors"](https://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/44267).

In 2015, Julio joined the Metals Physics Division during his post-doctorate to study "Irradiation Damage in Nanomaterials during their Characterization by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)", under the supervision of Dr. Eugenia Zelaya.

In 2016, he became a permanent member of the group as a [CONICET Researcher](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/new_scp/detalle.php?id=28714&datos_academicos=yes). His scientific interests focus on the study of the structure and properties of nanomaterials, with emphasis on the characterization of the  defects produced by ion irradiation and their influence on the properties of the materials. He has been involved in the development of new techniques for the characterization of nanomaterials, such as the use of electron microscopy to study the structure of materials at the atomic scale, and the use of synchrotron radiation to study the electronic structure of materials.

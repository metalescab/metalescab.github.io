               reproducible, and for each event the activity and the echoes
               last about 1 ms; (b) the intensity of acoustic emission is more

               martensite microplates. The results for the observed microplates
               indicate the following. (1) During the process of
               forward/reverse transformation two kinds of acoustic emission
               are detected, only one of them being associated with the
               appearance/disappearance of visible martensite domains in the

               equivalent to the acoustic emission of the $\beta$ phase, and
               with comparable intensity to that produced by a microplate, is
               not related with any observable microplate, and is probably
               connected to lesser changes in the surface martensite. (2) The
               acoustic emission peaks can be related to the existence of
               pinnings, created by defects, in the martensite domains. (3)
               There is no proportionality between the acoustic emission and
               the mass of the material. (4) The thermal hysteresis can be

               different martensitic phases, mainly in Cu-Zn-Al, are compared.
               It is shown that the differences in enthalpy of formation
               between the fcc type 3R or 6R and the 9R, 18R or 2H structures
               are above all due to a lattice distortion which reduces the
               energy per stacking fault, considering 9R, 18R and 2H as a basic
               face centered lattice into which faults are introduced on each
               third or second plane. In the second part the factors are
               discussed which are important in the relative stabilities not
               only between the matrix and martensite phases, but also for the
               equilibrium phases in the noble metal alloys. These are : i) the
               vibrational entropy difference $\Delta$S, which is a function
               mainly of electron concentration e/a. It depends little, if at
               all, on the special alloy system, on the degree of long range
               order, or on temperature ; ii) the stability of the average
               periodic lattice which is a smooth function of e/a, without any
               indication of nesting effects at intermediate e/a ; iii) the
               pair interchange energies which depend strongly on the alloy
               system. They are a function of the pair distance but otherwise
               are structure independent. They determine most of the enthalpy
               of formation and simultaneously account for the long range order
               contribution.",

  abstract  = "Results from martensitic transformations are used to evaluate
               stabilities of the equilibrium phases in the Hume-Rothery
               electron compounds based on Cu, Ag and Au, and to give arguments
               why the electron concentration plays such an important role in
               the selection of the crystal structures. It is shown that the
               vibrational entropy difference observed for the martensitic
               transformation from ordered bcc to the close packed martensite
               and its e/a dependence can also account for the entropy
               difference $\Delta$S $\alpha$/$\beta$ between the equilibrium
               $\alpha$ and $\beta$ at high temperatures, and can be made
               largely responsible for the composition dependence of the
               ($\alpha$+$\beta$) two phase field. The enthalpy of mixing can
               be decomposed into a small term which depends on the average
               periodic lattice, which is different in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ but
               which is nearly the same in all alloys studied, and a
               contribution which is due to the difference in the properties of
               the atoms and which can be expressed by pair interchange
               energies. This contribution depends strongly on the specific
               alloy system, but is independent of structure, which is
               compatible with a pair interchange energy depending only on pair
               distance but not on structure, as suggested by simple
               pseudopotential theory. The same pair interchange energies
               account also for long range order and the critical ordering
               temperature. The evaluation for several alloy systems shows a
               surprisingly good agreement within this picture, and permits to
               understand better why the electron concentration plays such an
               important role also for other structures, although the energy
               contribution of the conduction electrons is only a small part of
               the total enthalpy of formation of any of the equilibrium

               long-wave primary and a secondary shuffle type shear which occur
               simultaneously. The primary and part of the secondary shear are
               equivalent to the Bain distortion, and the rest of the secondary
               shear corresponds to the lattice invariant shear of the
               phenomenological theories. This description permits us to obtain
               information on the multiplicity of the
               transformation-retransformation paths. It is shown that the
               shape-memory alloys have a single possible path when the matrix
               phase possesses long-range order. The selection of the activated

               we have performed numerical simulations. To simulate the

               phenomenological analysis of the structural properties and the
               high-temperature reactions of the $\Omega$ phase formed by
               quenching (`q') bcc ($\beta$) Zr--Nb alloys. In the first part
               of the work an extensive database with lattice parameters (LPs)
               for the $\Omega$q and the untransformed $\beta$q phase is
               developed on the basis of neutron diffraction measurements.
               Various striking features of the LP vs. composition relations
               are detected, and a new method of analysis is applied which
               involves the concept of a `reference behavior' (RB) describing
               the probable properties of each individual phase if it were
               unaffected by the other structures in the heterogeneous alloys.
               In this way, a detailed evaluation is performed of the effects
               of $\Omega$q/$\beta$q coherence strains upon the LPs of these
               two phases. In the second part of the work, neutron
               thermodiffraction studies are reported of the structural
               properties of the $\Omega$q + $\beta$q two-phase alloys at 300 K
               ⩽ T ⩽ 650 K. Extensive LP vs. time results are discussed. On
               this basis, the structural properties of the $\Omega$a phase
               formed isothermally upon aging (`a') are established, and
               compared with those of the $\Omega$q phase. In addition, new
               information is discussed on the evolution of the $\Omega$a +
               $\beta$a system toward thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, it
               is shown how the present method of analysis may also be used to
               obtain indirect information of both theoretical and practical
               interest. In particular, considerable evidence is presented
               indicating that the Nb content of the $\Omega$a phase decreases
               upon aging whereas that of $\beta$a increases. Finally, it is
               shown how these composition changes might be used to reconcile
               much of the long-standing conflicting reports concerning the

               embedded in the Al matrix upon heating and annealing up to 600
               °C was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At

               studied by transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), electron
               back-scatter diffraction (EBSD), and TEM. The am-Al2O3 network
               remained stable after annealing at 400 °C for 24 h. In-situ TEM
               studies revealed that at temperatures $\geq$450 °C, phase
               transformation of the am-Al2O3 network to crystalline
               $\gamma$-Al2O3 particles occurred. After annealing at 600 °C for
               24 h the transformation was completed, whereby only nanometric
               $\gamma$-Al2O3 particles with an average size of 28 nm resided
               on the high angle grain boundaries of Al. Due to the pinning

               remained unchanged during annealing up to 600 °C for 24 h. The

               purity Al powders with a mean particle size in the range of 1--9
               µm. As-forged HITEMAL consisted of (sub)micrometric Al grains
               (matrix) decorated with nanometric thick amorphous Al2O3
               (a-Al2O3) skeleton. Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) free of
               Al2O3 were located in the Al grain interior. The Al grain size
               and the portion of LAGBs increased with the increase in the
               relative powder surface area. As-forged HITEMAL shows excellent
               thermal stability up to 400 °C for 24 h. Annealing at
               temperatures $\geq$450 °C led to crystallization and
               morphological transformation from a-Al2O3 skeleton to nanometric
               $\gamma$-Al2O3 particles. Owing to the pinning effect of Al2O3
               phase, no Al grain growth took place during annealing up to 500
               °C. HITEMAL showed attractive mechanical properties especially
               when tested at 300 °C (yield strength up to 220 MPa, Young׳s
               modulus up to 58 GPa). Despite the presence of a nearly
               continuous a-Al2O3 skeleton along adjacent Al grains, forged
               HITEMAL materials had reasonable room temperature elongation of
               7--26\%. HITEMAL׳s elongation decreased as the Al grain size
               decreased and with increased testing temperature. The loss in
               elongation (uniform and total) was attributed to the
               inhomogeneous flow, which occurred due to high densities of high
               angle grain boundaries (dislocation sinks) and small content of
               LAGBs. The strength of HITEMAL stemmed from grain boundary
               mediated strengthening mechanisms. The results showed a positive
               deviation from the Hall--Petch plot, which is typical behavior
               of ultrafine-grained metals. Transformation of a-Al2O3 skeleton

               measurements developed by Benites et al. using a neutron
               diffraction technique, which was reported in paper I of this
               series. Alloys with Nb contents between 4 at.\% and 31 at.\% are
               considered. Deviations from Vegard's-law type of behaviour in
               the variation of the atomic volume of the $\omega$ phase with

               other relevant structural data, are used to establish and
               analyse the composition dependence of the key IDs of the various
               metastable phases. In particular, the behaviour of the shortest

               find that the SID values for the $\omega$ phase formed in the

  abstract  = "Steam generator tubes (SGTs) represents up to 60\% of the total
               primary pressure retaining boundary area of a nuclear power
               plant. They have been found susceptible to diverse degradation
               mechanisms during service. Due to the significance of a SGT
               failure on the plant safe operation, nuclear regulatory
               authorities have established tube plugging or repairing criteria
               which are based on the defect depth. The widespreadly used
               ``40\% criterion'' proposed in the 70s is an example whose use
               is still recommended in the last editions of the ASME Boiler and
               Pressure Vessel Code. In the present work, an alternative, more
               realistic and less conservative methodology for SGT integrity
               evaluation is proposed. It is based on the Failure Assessment
               Diagram (FAD) and takes advantage of the recent developments in
               non-destructive techniques which allow a more comprehensive
               characterization of tube defects, i.e., depth, length,
               orientation and type. The proposed approach has been applied to:
               the study of the influence of primary and secondary stresses on
               tube integrity; the prediction of failure mode (i.e., ductile
               fracture or plastic collapse) of defective SGTs for varied crack
               geometries and loading conditions; the analysis of the
               sensibility of tensile and fracture properties with temperature.
               The potentiality of the FAD as a comprehensive methodology for
               predicting the failure loads and failure modes of flawed SGTs is
               highlighted.",

               range of sizes allows an analysis of the relations between the

               progress of the transition occurring upon heating are identified
               on thermodynamic and structural basis, and the corresponding
               temperature ranges are determined. In particular, the step where
               most of the transition takes place (the ``melting step'') is
               identified and described in terms of the change in the relative
               amount of two kinds of atoms, viz., those forming solid

               introduced. Finally, it is shown that a thermodynamic, van't
               Hoff analysis of the size-dependence of Keq yields values of the

               techniques are available despite such technique would be
               beneficial in a variety of technological applications. Thus,
               this work introduces an innovative method for assessing
               stress--strain properties at a sub‐millimeter scale and
               illustrates the potential of the technique by evaluating the
               strength of a sub‐region in the HAZ from welded steels pipes.
               The method employs a fully instrumented stage inside a scanning
               electron microscope that stretches small tensile specimens (2.0
               mm $\times$ 0.5 mm cross‐section, 12.5 mm gage length) while
               registering detailed images of the deformed region. The
               specimens, cut from full‐scale welds, include in their gage
               length weld metal, base metal and HAZ and have an 85 $\mu$m
               period grid of evaporated lead on their surface to visualise the
               deformation. Upon straining, local strain is determined by
               correlating sequential images of the specimen surface with an

               local strain within the HAZ and the load values recorded during

               obtained by cold rolling and with a final straight annealing
               treatment was selected. The microstructure before and after
               pull-pull pseudoelastic cycling was analyzed by transmission
               electron microscopy. The observed microstructure of the ribbons
               consisted of a B2 austenite phase with very small grains, 50
               nm--2 $\mu$m in diameter, a large density of dislocations and
               Ni4Ti3 precipitates. After cycling, the only observed
               differences are a slight increase in the dislocation density and
               regions with the R-phase. This suggests that the decrease in the
               transformation stress could be attributed to the nucleation
               process of the particular dislocations necessary to accommodate
               the martensite in the present configuration of grains and

               techniques,viz., dilatometry and electrical resistivity
               measurements, which are applied to the whole composition range
               where the transformation can be detected,i.e., between 10 and 30
               pct Mn. We used theA s andM s temperatures as input information
               in an analysis based on thermodynamic models for the Gibbs
               energy of the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal
               close-packed (hcp) phases. In these models, the magnetic
               contribution to Gibbs energy is accounted for, which allows us
               to study, by calculation, the influence of the entropy of
               magnetic ordering upon the relative stability of the phases. The
               picture of magnetic effects upon the fcc/hcp transformation that
               emerges from our work is as follows. At low Mn contents, the
               martensitic transformation temperatures are larger than the
               N{\'e}el temperature of the fcc phase, and bothA s andM s

               discuss the available information on the fcc/hcp equilibrium
               temperature for Fe at atmospheric pressure. At sufficiently
               large Mn contents, we haveM s <T yN , which implies that the fcc
               phase orders antiferromagnetically before transforming to the
               hcp phase. Since hcp remains paramagnetic down to lower
               temperatures, the ordering reaction in fcc leads to a relative
               stabilization of this phase, which is reflected in a drastic,
               nonlinear decrease ofM s.",

  abstract  = "The influence of natural aging on precipitation hardening of an
               Al--Mg--Si alloy was investigated by mechanical testing and
               quantitative transmission electron microscopy. It was found that
               natural aging increases yield stress and reduces ductility,
               which is attributed to the formation of Mg/Si clusters. The
               evolution of tensile properties saturates after around 7 days
               natural aging. Artificial aging for 30 min at 180 °C after
               solution treatment resulted in an important increase in yield
               strength and loss of ductility, due to the rapid precipitation
               of the $\beta$′′ intermediate phase. Previous natural aging
               progressively reduces the strengthening effect of 30 min/180 °C
               artificial aging, completely suppressing it after 7 days
               pre-aging. Microhardness evolution during 180 °C artificial
               aging was followed in samples that were aged immediately after
               quenching, and with 7 days natural aging before artificial
               aging. In addition, microstructural characterization using TEM
               was carried out at specific artificial aging times. Previous
               natural aging was found to reduce the initial hardening rate,
               producing a delay in the formation of $\beta$′′ precipitates.
               The peak-aging condition was reached almost at the same aging
               time. However, longer $\beta$′′ precipitates with a lower volume

  abstract  = "Mechanical damping applications could benefit from the large
               hysteresis, large pseudoelastic strain and the fact that the
               transformation stresses of the 18R↔6R martensite--martensite
               transformation depend very little on temperature in Cu-based
               alloys. This work presents the 18R↔6R mechanical cycling
               behavior of CuZnAl shape-memory alloy single crystals with
               electronic concentration e/a=1.48. A fine distribution of gamma
               phase nanoprecipitates is introduced to prevent plastic
               deformation of the 6R phase. Results show that, although
               significant 6R stabilization is observed at very low frequencies
               (below 10−2 Hz), it is possible to obtain more than 1000 stable
               pseudoelastic cycles with only minor changes in transformation
               stresses and hysteresis width at frequencies above 10−1 Hz. A
               more pronounced decrease in transformation stresses is observed
               after 1000 cycles. Nevertheless, the decrease in hysteresis is
               small up to 2000 cycles. Reported and present results indicate
               that pair interchange of atoms can explain the stabilization of
               6R under quasistatic experimental conditions. However, at higher
               frequencies of cycling, stabilization of this martensite shows
               additional features, leading to a dynamic stabilization with
               slight effects on the mechanical behavior at the required
               frequency and number of cycles. On the whole, the behavior of
               this transformation is unique and very promising.",

               successive stress induced transformations from the high
               temperature austenitic DO3 structure ($\beta$1) to the 18R and
               to the 6R martensites were considered. Several distinct features
               which characterize the stress induced transformations in
               Cu--Al--Be and distinguish this system from other Cu-based
               shape-memory alloys are reported in this work. It was found that
               the 6R phase forms from a distorted 18R and that this stress
               induced transformation is highly reversible with no plastic
               deformation accompanying the process. The stress induced
               transformation from the distorted 18R to the 6R structure
               exhibits wide hysteresis, comparable with values observed in the
               NiTi system. A slightly negative temperature dependence of the
               critical stress to induce the 6R martensite was determined.

	abstract = {In this work, it is shown that thiol-protected Au nanoparticles (AuNPs@SR) of approximately 3.4 nm size suffered unexpectedly high radiation damage under standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operating conditions. For metallic systems (conducting sample), it is expected that the greatest contribution to the damage comes from knock-on displacement, but radiolysis is the most probable radiation damage mechanism for organic samples. The radiation damage of the electron beam produces huge changes in AuNPs’ structure, leading to coalescence of the Au cores when their \{100\} surfaces are facing each other. The complete coalescence process involve thiol desoprtion, AuNPs’ reorientation, and surface diffusion of Au adatoms, which produce the oriented attachment of the Au cores. The knock-on displacement cannot explain by itself the time taken by the entire process. Through a rigorous analysis, we rationalize the results considering that because of the small size of AuNPs they have a lower electron density than the bulk material which favors radiolytic damage.},

	abstract = {Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ω-carboxylic acid thiols are very important in the surface modification of metals, especially on gold surfaces. Indeed, the 3-mercaptopropanoic acid (MPA) and its ester or amide derivatives are widely used for SAM-based sensor design. It was already shown that MPA does not suffer C–S bond scission when adsorbed on Au. On the other hand, in this work we demonstrate that its simplest derivative, methyl 3-mercapto propionate (Me-MPA), is prone to form significant amounts of atomic sulfur when adsorbed on Au. The MPA derivatives are more sensible than MPA itself to alkaline solutions, and its SAM-based sensors will rapidly degrade given atomic sulfur. In this work, we study the simplest MPA derivative Me-MPA SAMs on preferentially oriented Au(111) surfaces by XPS and electrochemical measurements. It was found that the desulfuration of Me-MPA depends on its preparation conditions (grown from ethanol or toluene solution) and on its post-treatment with alkaline solution. In order},

	abstract = {We present a quantitative X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study on the electron-induced degradation of selfassembled monolayers of n-dodecanethiol on Au(100) and Au(111). This study is motivated by the lack of mechanistic explanations of the oriented attachment of n-dodecanethiolateprotected nanoparticles exposed to irradiation during imaging by transmission electron microscopy. The coalescence of these nanoparticles preferentially occurs through the encounter of the (100) faces. It could be hypothesized that thiolate desorption from the Au(100) faces is faster than that on Au(111), which would overcome the steric hindrance for the encounter of the (100) metallic surfaces. Nevertheless, we found that the organic material desorbs at comparable rates and extension from both singlecrystalline surfaces, despite the fact that the most abundant damaging products are diﬀerent on these surfaces. Furthermore, although RS−R′ prevails on Au(111) while RS−SR is formed on Au(100), complete moieties derived from dodecanethiolate are the main desorption products from both SAMs. In addition, we provided arguments based on the reaction mechanism to describe the crosslinking of hydrocarbon chains and to explain why sulfur-containing species desorbs at the same rate from both single-crystalline surfaces.},

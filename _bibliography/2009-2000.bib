  abstract = {The martensitic transformation is a diffusionless first order phase transformation in the solid state, which proceeds by the nucleation and growth of the new phase. It is of importance to understand in which way the coordinated movement of atoms occurs during the transformation. This topic will be discussed for the transformation from the body centered long-range ordered structure to the face centered or hexagonal one, as is observed in many noble metal alloys. Also the transformation in the iron alloys from the face centered austenite to the body centered or hexagonal martensite will be dealt with. The transformation takes place only when the martensite becomes more stable thermodynamically. The factors that control the stability will be evaluated for the noble metal alloys, especially the Cu-Zn-Al alloys which have been studied extensively at the Centro Atómico Bariloche. Since the alloys possess long-range order, the influence of order on the phase stability is analyzed. As will be shown, long-range order is also decisive to obtain alloys with a small hysteresis between transformation and retransformation, which is the basis for the superelastic and shape memory behavior.},

  abstract = {Martensitic transformation and the low temperature plastic deformation proceed by the easiest coordinated atom movements, i.e.~those which produce the least amount of energy dissipation. The two requirements, namely that the correct martensitic crystal structure results, and in addition that an undistorted interface between the matrix and the martensite is necessary, lead in general to more than one shear system. As will be discussed, the selection of the shear systems to comply with the transformation crystallography underlies the same selection principles as deformation by slip. Three examples are presented: the Cu–Zn based noble metal alloys, the Ni–Ti based ones and the Fe alloys. Whereas plastic deformation is induced by applied stresses, the martensitic transformation is controlled by a change in Gibbs free energy, but can be modified by applying stresses. The creation of transformation strains leads to an interaction with applied stresses. The different types of interaction between applied stress, transformation strain and associated plastic deformation are discussed for the three alloy groups.},

  abstract = {Abstract For an evaluation of the crystallography of the martensitic phases three aspects are important: 1. The transformation mechanism: How does the martensite phase nucleate and grow within the matrix phase, taking into account that diffusional processes are absent, but that nevertheless large shape changes occur. 2. The influence of the transformation mechanism on the selection of the martensite structures. 3. The relationship between the stability of the martensite and of the equilibrium phases that are obtained when diffusion is permitted. In this paper mainly the first aspect will be discussed, using as prototypes the Cu based noble metal shape memory alloys with a transformation from a bcc based lattice to a close packed one, and the Fe-Pt alloys with the transformation from fcc to bcc. It will be shown that the atom movements during the transformation can be described by a combination of two shears, with the possible exception of the bcc to hexagonal transformation. Arguments are presented to substantiate this mechanism. It also permits to discuss the factors which control the energy dissipation during these shears and thus determine the hysteresis between the transformation and the retransformation. It is suggested that in order to get a good shape memory effect with little hysteresis it is necessary to have a long range ordered matrix.},

This description permits us to obtain information on the multiplicity of the transformation�retransformation paths. It is shown that the shape-memory alloys have a single possible path when the matrix phase possesses long-range order. The selection of the activated shear systems can be correlated with their resistance against small displacements, given by the corresponding elastic constants.

The evolution of the phases during mechanical alloying of equiatomic amounts of the pure elements was also investigated. It was found that the speed of the process depends on the milling configuration. It was also determined that the powder temperature on milling does not exceed 373 K. Low temperature thermal treatments allowed to extend down to 373 K the β phase field range in the phase diagram. This novel result could be obtained due to the unique properties of ball milling, which permits to reach phases in the phase diagram following low temperature paths. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results confirm previous experiments at higher energies showing deviations from theoretical predictions based on the standard multiple scattering theory. In order to prove that the effect of crystal structure is one of the main causes of these deviations we have performed numerical simulations. To simulate the polycrystalline structure in a realistic way, we have made an analysis of the target by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Including these characteristics in the simulation, together with the effect of vibrations and crystal disorder we analyzed the corresponding angular distribution. To evaluate the role of channeling, we also measured angular distributions of protons in a 〈100〉 gold foil and made the corresponding numerical simulations.

To achieve the SMA as a guaranteed material for damping of structures requires a reliability study of the static and dynamic properties adapted to each type of application. Here we present static (temperature and time effects) and dynamic actions in pseudo-elastic NiTi SMA. We concern with long time effects of temperature and time mainly in beta phase. NiTi results are presented, including measurements of electrical resistance as a function of temperature and time, DSC to −80°C (TA Instruments), non-conventional conduction calorimetry (to 80 K), and several X-ray diffraction spectra at different temperatures. Diffusion effects are present, and all the measurements show that transformation temperatures change with time of aging even at moderate temperatures (i.e., near 100°C), depending on time and temperature. It is possible to visualize the diffusion change in the R phase transformation via classical X-ray characterization. We include some results of pre-stressing effects applying the stress at different zones of the hysteresis cycle. The experimental analysis shows that coupling between stress and temperature enhances the changes. For long times (10, 20 years) and direct sunny actions, more deep analysis is required. Finally, some dynamic effects in cycling affecting the SMA creep are outlined.},

As a part of a systematic investigation of the structural and bonding properties of the bcc and Ω phases, and of the bcc → Ω phase transformation in TMs and alloys, we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the structural relations between these phases in Ti, Zr, Hf and in other TMs. The approach is as follows. First, we establish the most general geometrical relations connecting the lattice parameters and interatomic distances (IDs) of the bcc and Ω structures. Next, we focus on the ratio between the relevant IDs of these phases, which are assessed on the basis of an extensive database with experimental and theoretical information. Both stable and metastable structures are considered, and various remarkable regularities in ID ratios are discussed. Finally, in the light of the systematics of ID ratios established in the present work, a discussion is made of the probable lattice parameters for the Ω phase of Hf, which are not yet accurately known from direct measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with (i) the establishment of Pauling's bond length vs. bond number relation (BLBNR) for Ti, Zr and Hf, and (ii) the analysis of the connections between the parameters entering into the BLBNR and the experimental interatomic distances (IDs) in the known solid phases of these elements. Recently assessed ID data on the hcp structure, which is the stable phase at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (RTAP) as well as on the bcc and omega (Ω) structures, which are metastable at RTAP, are treated in terms of the BLBNR, and various approaches are tested for the evaluation of the univalent metallic bond-length parameter, D(1), of Ti, Zr and Hf. Next, a comparison is made with Pauling's method, which is based on determining an optimum D(1) parameter. With these results, a new interpretation is presented of the so-called Jamieson correlation, which involves the possibility of a connection between D(1) and the shortest ID in the Ω phase. Finally, the BLBNR is applied to the metastable fcc structure of Ti, Zr and Hf, and a new evaluation is performed of the difference between metallic bond lengths for coordination numbers 12 (D(12)) and 8 (D(8)), which is compared with early generalizations on D(12)-D(8).},

In the first place, the effect of temperature changes upon the lattice parameters of the b and W phases in alloys with 10 and 18 at.\% Nb was monitored using neutron thermodiffraction. A method of analysis is applied to the data which involves a confrontation between the observed structural properties and an idealised -or ``reference'- behaviour (RB) which admits a simple mathematical description. A generalised form of Vegard's law is adopted as RB for the b phase, whereas a specific RB is proposed for the W structure. The experimental data are well accounted for by this interpretation scheme, leading to a picture of the isothermal reactions occurring at high temperature which involves the transfer of Nb from the W to the b phase. Finally, the neutron diffraction data on the W phase are combined with an electron microscopy study for the alloy with 10 at.\% Nb aged at 773 K, which provides information on the composition of this phase and its evolution towards thermodynamic equilibrium.},

In the first part of the work an extensive database with lattice parameters (LPs) for the Ωqand the untransformed βqphase is developed on the basis of neutron diffraction measurements. Various striking features of the LP vs. composition relations are detected, and a new method of analysis is applied which involves the concept of a 'reference behavior' (RB) describing the probable properties of each individual phase if it were unaffected by the other structures in the heterogeneous alloys. In this way, a detailed evaluation is performed of the effects of Ωq/βqcoherence strains upon the LPs of these two phases. In the second part of the work, neutron thermodiffraction studies are reported of the structural properties of the Ωq+ βqtwo-phase alloys at 300 K ≤ T ≤ 650 K. Extensive LP vs. time results are discussed. On this basis, the structural properties of the Ωaphase formed isothermally upon aging ('a') are established, and compared with those of the Ωqphase. In addition, new information is discussed on the evolution of the Ωa+ βasystem toward thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, it is shown how the present method of analysis may also be used to obtain indirect information of both theoretical and practical interest. In particular, considerable evidence is presented indicating that the Nb content of the Ωaphase decreases upon aging whereas that of βaincreases. Finally, it is shown how these composition changes might be used to reconcile much of the long-standing conflicting reports concerning the structural properties of the Ωqand Ωametastable phases. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Fe-Mn-Si-based alloys have been promising systems for shape memory applications for a long time. However, the need of a complicated training process in order to get the desired properties avoided their practical use. Recently, several new Fe-Mn-Si-based alloys, with interesting properties, containing different types of precipitates have been developed. In these new systems, the shape memory improvement is obtained either by the sole introduction of precipitates, or by the combination of a simple thermomechanical treatment followed by a subsequent precipitation. In this work, we investigate the effect of a thermomechanical treatment performed at a temperature of 870 K on the shape memory properties of an Fe-28Mn-6Si-5Cr (wt.\%). We have found that a simple treatment, without the necessity of introducing precipitates, is enough to obtain good shape memory properties. Transmission electron microscopy shows that a large density of stacking faults is produced during the treatment. From these observations we deduce that this large stacking fault density is clearly related to the observed properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Under this surface preparation conditions the new fcc phase nucleates with a different geometry than the one reported in previous papers in which surfaces were finished by electropolishing. In the present case, we observe individual fcc precipitates with a well defined geometry.

Upon quenching, two additional structures are formed and retained metastably, viz. the hcp (alpha') phase, which forms through a martensitic transformation, and the omega (omega) phase, which forms by a displacive transformation involving the collapse of (111)(bcc) planes. The lattice parameters (LPs) of the beta, alpha' and omega phases are determined as functions of the Nb content in the composition interval 4 less than or equal to at.\% Nb less than or equal to 31, which represents a significant expansion of the experimental database for these various metastable structures. With the present data, reliable trends in the composition dependence of the LPs are established. In general, a smooth, essentially linear dependence upon the Nb content is detected, corresponding to Vegard's law. However, a striking deviation from this simple behaviour is detected in the a(omega) parameter for Zr-rich alloys, i.e. in the region where this LP is directly related to the shortest interatomic distance (LD) in the omega phase. The need for a new analysis of the composition dependence of the various IDs in the omega phase is emphasized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

The analysis is based on the database with lattice parameter (LP) measurements developed by Benites et al. using a neutron diffraction technique, which was reported in paper I of this series. Alloys with Nb contents between 4 at.\% and 31 at.\% are considered. Deviations from Vegard's-law type of behaviour in the variation of the atomic volume of the ω phase with the at.\% Nb are discussed, which are related to the peculiar behaviour of the a\$-ω/ LP of this phase in a narrow composition range, close to pure Zr. The LPs, together with other relevant structural data, are used to establish and analyse the composition dependence of the key IDs of the various metastable phases. In particular, the behaviour of the shortest ID (SID) of the ω phase is investigated in detail. We find that the SID values for the ω phase formed in the composition range 0≤at.\% Nb≤10 are even smaller than Pauling's single bond-length for Zr, a quantity which is involved in the so-called Jamieson correlation for the ω phase in elements and alloys.

Also, strategies for estimating vibrational entropies and melting points from FP calculations or chemical systematics are discussed. Some strategies for including SRO (beyond pair correlations) in CALPHAD calculations are discussed in the last section. Sections II and V are concerned with using FP electronic structure calculations to obtain composition dependent thermodynamic functions and physical properties. Sections III and IV (primarily) deal with stoichiometric compounds, and semiempirical chemical systematics.},

  abstract = {The monotonic fracture micromechanisms of an aramid-aluminum laminate were studied using very small single edge bend specimens, SE(B) tested in a small-instrumented testing machine inside a scanning electron microscope. The fracture process was followed by simultaneous observation of the sample and recording the loading variables. The instability fracture toughness was strongly dependent on the fibre-reinforced epoxy layer and the crack-growth in the external aluminum layers, prior to fracture instability, was influenced by the notch acuity. The load versus load-line displacement behaviour and load instabilities were similar to the ones obtained by conventional testing procedures. The technique implemented proved to be a powerful tool to study the fracture micromechanisms of aramid-aluminum laminates or other fibre-metal laminates and to correlate them with the recorded macro events.},

  abstract = {With the intention of determining the local thickness within a crystalline thin foil specimen, by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a method previously proposed by Zuo and Shi [J.M. Zuo, Y.F. Shi, Microsc. Microanal. 7 (Suppl. 2) (2001) 224-225] was applied. Using the convergent beam technique, with the incident beam parallel to a zone axis with low indices, diffraction patterns were obtained for some aluminum alloys with low solute content. These patterns were contrasted with those obtained from simulations based on the dynamic theory with Bloch's waves formalism. The local thickness of the thin foil was then obtained by visually comparing the simulated patterns with the experimental one. Comparison of the proposed method with that based on the analysis of two-beam convergent beam patterns [P.M. Kelly, A. Jostsons, R.G. Blake, J.G. Napier, Phys. Stat. Solidi (a) 31 (1975) 771-780] and with that based on the ratio of intensity of the zero loss peak to the total intensity in an electron energy loss spectrum [R.F. Egerton, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy in the Electron Microscope, second ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1996] was carried out. A very good agreement between thicknesses determined using the different methods was found. The sensitivity of the method of Zuo et al. was found to be about 1 or 2 nm. The advantages and limitations of the different methods are discussed. The method of Zuo et al. can provide fast and reliable results and can be applied in all modern instruments. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the damage zone and defects produced by TiN thin film deposition on stainless steel using DC magnetron sputtering to produce collisions between the TiN ions and the substrate. The PVD process used a low operative pressure, reducing the bombardment damage on the substrate, in comparison with other methods. Internal friction (IF) and elastic modulus measurements were carried out in TiN-PVD coated AISI 304 stainless steel, using a sub-resonant torsion pendulum (f ≅ 1 Hz) and a vibrant-reed instrument (f ≅ 103Hz). Some experiments showed several internal friction peaks, which are attributed to dislocation relaxation and to martensitic transformation from γ to α′. The characterization was carried out with X-ray, AFM and SEM. Analysis of X-ray peaks indicates a residual deformation in the order of 0.0005-0.0009 for γ-phase and 0.0006-0.00204 for α′-phase. Two methods are presented to determine the adhesion energy by IF in coated materials: for the first the enthalpy is determined by means of isochronal IF measurements, while for the second it is determined using isothermal measurements. These produce an image of damage caused by the bombardment on the substrate, especially of the residual defects. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To study the origin of this evolution, a Ni-Ti ribbon (50.9 at.\% Ni) obtained by cold rolling and with a final straight annealing treatment was selected. The microstructure before and after pull-pull pseudoelastic cycling was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The observed microstructure of the ribbons consisted of a B2 austenite phase with very small grains, 50 nm-2 μm in diameter, a large density of dislocations and Ni4Ti3precipitates. After cycling, the only observed differences are a slight increase in the dislocation density and regions with the R-phase. This suggests that the decrease in the transformation stress could be attributed to the nucleation process of the particular dislocations necessary to accommodate the martensite in the present configuration of grains and precipitates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A, 1995, vol. 26A, p. 1957â69), presents a study of the energetics of the heterogeneous nucleation of hcp martensite in the fcc matrix of the Fe-Mn system. A major goal of the work is the exploration of the various qualitative and quantitative consequences of applying the Olson and Cohen approach (OCA) to the most reliable information on the Fe-Mn system. To this end, an extensive assessment of the quantities involved in the OCA is performed. The selected Gibbs energy and the lattice parameter descriptions for fcc and hcp are based on recent experimental studies. Explicit calculations are presented of the key quantities in the OCA, including those quantities that have not yet been measured. In particular, a probable range of values is established for the surface energy parameter Ï, which plays a crucial role in the treatment of the nucleation size. On these bases, values are derived for the probable number of atomic planes (n C) of the embryo, which, according to the OCA, is at the condition of spontaneous growth. Predictions of the Mn content upon n C are also reported. The present attempt to calculate in detail the energetics of the fcc âhcp martensitic transformation also revealed the lack of thermophysical data for Fe-Mn alloys. The need for experimental studies of various relevant quantities is emphasized.},

We show the magnetization behavior for a tube of 700 nm of diameter and 3.5 μm length. We discuss the simulation for different temperatures and external fields. As a main result, we show that the distribution of inter-granular distances has a unique behavior for tubular structures of similar diameter/length aspect ratio, independent of their sizes. This scaling relation allows us to perform the simulations using a tube of smaller dimensions. We succeed in explaining the magnetization curves, finding that dipolar interaction is necessary to explain the experimental behavior and that the grains behave as having magnetic dead layers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Once a critical volume of 18R martensite has formed, 2H martensite is induced in a β-18R mixture at temperatures between Msand T-Ms= 71 K. The pseudoelastic cycles exhibit high stress hysteresis and the 2H phase is retained on unloading.

  abstract = {Cyclic loading is one of the generic characteristic features of many of the present and potential future applications of NiTi shape memory alloys, no matter whether they exploit mechanical (pseudo-elasticity) or thermal shape memory (one and two way effect). Cyclic loading may well be associated with structural and functional fatigue, which both limit the service life of shape memory components. By "structural fatigue" we mean the microstructural damage that accumulates during cyclic loading and eventually leads to fatigue failure. There is a need to understand how microstructures can be optimized to provide good fatigue resistance. The term "functional fatigue" indicates that shape memory effects like the working displacement in a one way effect (1WE) actuator or the dissipated energy in a loading-unloading cycle of a pseudo-elastic (PE) damping application decrease with increasing cycle numbers. This is also due to a gradual change in microstructure. In both cases it is important to know how fatigue cycling affects shape memory properties. The present paper considers structural and functional fatigue of NiTi shape memory alloys. It discusses four cases of fatigue in NiTi shape memory alloys: (1) The evolution of the stress-strain hysteresis in low cycle pull-pull fatigue of pseudo-elastic NiTi wires. (2) Bending-rotation fatigue rupture of pseudo-elastic NiTi wires. (3) Strain localization during the stress induced formation of martensite. (4) Generic features of functional fatigue in NiTi shape memory actuator springs. The paper shows that fatigue of shape memory alloys is a fascinating research field and highlights the need for further work in this area. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The authors have previously reported an estimate of the energy associated with the inhibition effect of γ′ martensite after β ↔ β′ + γ′ cycling in CuAlNi single crystals. In this paper, a microscopic model is proposed to explain the γ′ inhibition, related to the localized interaction between a dislocation array and the twinned γ′ structure. Dislocations with Burgers vector [1 0 0]βand line direction [1 1 1]βin an isotropic β matrix are considered. The model takes into account the interaction between the martensitic stress-free transformation strains and the stress field created by the dislocation arrays. It is shown that the interaction is different for each twin-related variant in the γ′ martensite. The energy necessary to maintain the right volume relationship of the twinned γ′ variants to produce an undistorted β/γ′ habit plane is defined as the inhibition energy. A value of around 12 J mol-1was obtained, which is in reasonable agreement with experimental results. © 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

  abstract = {The bce --{$>$}Ohm phase transition is diffusionless: two-thirds of the atoms in the (111) planes of the bcc phase collapse into double layers, whereas the third remains a single layer. This transformation is observed in the group-IV elements Ti, Zr, and Hf at high pressure, but it may be induced at zero pressure by quenching the samples at room temperature in alloys of these elements with other transition metals (TM's). This paper presents a systematic theoretical study of the bcc--{$>$}Ohm transformation in Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo using the full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method. Equilibrium volumes, total-energy differences, density of electron states, and the band structure of Y, Zr, Nh, and Mo in the stable and metastable bcc and Ohm structures are presented. In addition, the bcc--{$>$}Ohm energy difference is studied as a function of the specific lattice distortion as well as of pressure. These results are related to a picture that involves the softening of the (2/3,2/3,2/3) longitudinal phonon mode. Charge-density calculations are performed for both the bcc and Ohm phases, and the electronic contributions that stiffen the bcc lattice against the Ohm distortion are identified. The physical picture of the electronic and chemical bonding effects emerging from the present work should be useful in understanding the observed trends in the relative stability of the Ohm phase in the TM's and their alloys.},

Their catalytic properties were studied in the metal-catalyzed reaction of cyclohexane dehydrogenation (300°C, 0.1MPa, WHSV=10h-1, H2/C6H12=30), the acid-catalyzed isomerization of n-butane (350°C, 0.1MPa, WHSV=1h-1, H2/C4H10=6), and the bifunctional hydroconversion of n-octane (300°C, 1.5MPa, WHSV=4h-1, H2/C8H18=6). TPR, XRD and FTIR of chemisorbed CO were also used in order to characterize the catalysts. The results showed a strong influence of the crystal phase on the activity of the acid function. A less marked effect was found for the metal-catalyzed reaction. An opposite relation between the two functions was seen with respect to this crystal structure influence. Among the sulfated catalysts, monoclinic Pt/SO42--ZrO2had the lowest activity in n-C4isomerization and the highest activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Tetragonal Pt/SO42--ZrO2catalysts were the most active in isomerization of n-butane. They had the lowest activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation and their metal properties were negligible. They were also the most active in n-C8conversion, producing mainly i-C4. Monoclinic catalysts had low cracking activity and produced mainly isooctane. Mixed phase catalysts had an intermediate behavior. While S poisoning of Pt was present as a uniform effect on all sulfated catalysts, the metal-acid behavior and the different Pt properties could be explained by a metal-support interaction between tetragonal SO42--ZrO2and Pt. The Pt-support interaction was analyzed both with a model of Pt particles encapsulation and a model of electron depletion. The electronic deficiency of Pt particles supported on SO42--ZrO2was evident in the shift of the IR bands of adsorbed CO. Further experimental work is however needed to get conclusive evidence about the nature of the Pt-support interaction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The corresponding cyclic flow stress components, the friction, σF, and the back stresses, σB, have been analyzed in relation to the observed microstructure. σF attains higher values at room temperature than in the intermediate range of temperatures in both thermal conditions due to the influence of the lattice friction stress on screw dislocations in the ferrite phase. The cyclic softening observed at all temperatures in aged samples is caused by the decrease of the back stress σB. The increase of σB in unaged samples at 300°C is consistent with the high dislocation density observed in the ferrite phase ascribed as a typical manifestation of dynamic strain aging.}

While the network maintains solely local connections, certain properties known only to Small World Networks may be extracted due to the dynamic nature of the model. At each time step the individuals are grouped into clusters creating neighborhoods or domains of fully connected agents. The boundaries of these domains change in time, corresponding to a situation where the links between individuals are dynamic only throughout the history of the network. A question that we pose is whether our model, which maintains a local structure such that diffusion calculations are possible, might lead to analytic or conceptual advances for the much more complicated case of diffusion on a static disordered network that exhibits the same macroscopic properties as our dynamic ordered network. To answer this, we compare certain properties which characterize the dynamic domain network to those of a Small World Network, and then analyze the diffusion coefficients for three possible domain mutations. We close with a comparison and confirmation of previous epidemiological work carried out on networks.},

Pore wetting of porous polycarbonate templates with the liquid precursor was followed by a two-stage thermal treatment to obtain single phase La0.325Pr0.300Ca0.375MnO3hollow and solid structures, with external diameter determined by the sacrificial template pore size. The first thermal stage, a microwave assisted denitration process, determines the shape of the structures. The second treatment, performed at 1073 K, allows to obtain the crystallographic structure of the compound. A variety of techniques (scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy) allowed to fully characterize the microstructure and morphology of these self-standing manganite nanostructures.

After high temperature (900 - 1100 degrees C) annealing, an array of beta-Sn islands epitaxially attached to the Si was observed at the SiO2/Si(100) interface due to the migration of the implanted Sn atoms. The breakdown of the planar SiO2/Si interface and the appearance of the island system is discussed in terms of the Sn - Si equilibrium properties.

An intrinsic thermoelasticity arises from the loss of the Burgers vectors translation symmetry of the dislocations when they are absorbed by the growing martensite. This thermoelasticity is proportional to the dislocation density and the fault energies, and depends on the geometrical orientation of the specimen surfaces, the orientation of the dislocation line directions and their associated stacking faults. The dependence of the temperature with the interface position is initially linear and then it tends gradually to a constant value.

A description of defects formed after cycling both in the bulk and on the surface is presented. A transition in the type of formed defects is found corresponding to an increase in the test temperature. Dislocation tangles parallel to the basal plane of the martensite, with trapped martensite inside, give way to dislocation arrays parallel to the habit plane of the transformation, as the test temperature increases. A correlation between this transition behavior and the mechanical evolution was found and the mechanisms of generation of bulk and surface defects are discussed. A correlation between dislocation arrays parallel to the habit plane and intrusion-extrusion defects on the surface is also presented. Both type of defects appear at temperatures higher than 173 K.

Finally, by combining the present measurements on the HCP phase with those on the face-centred cubic (FCC) phase reported in the first paper of this series, a detailed analysis is made of the changes in the interatomic distances as well as the relative volume change associated with the FCCHCP martensitic transformation.

Two calorimeters, viz., a thermal analysis differential scanning and a Perkin-Elmer calorimeter were used to determine the heat effect associated with the ε → γ transformation, in alloys subjected to several cycles of transformation (γ → ε) and retransformation (ε → γ). The amount of transformed material for each alloy was determined by dilatometry, and the volume difference between the ε and γ structures was taken from a recent assessment of the lattice parameters. It is found that the amount of material transformed on cooling is strongly affected by the increase in the Mn content, and is at least partly due to the stabilizing effect upon the γ phase of the magnetic ordering reaction, and to the microstructural changes which are induced by the thermal cycling through the martensitic transformation. A key result of the work is that the enthalpy difference decreases monotonically with increasing Mn content. This decrease should be relevant in the thermodynamic modeling of the ε and γ phases. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

When the target involves dampers for quakes in CE the number of full working cycles is relatively small (i.e. 200) but the application requires guaranteed behavior after several years of inactivity. On the contrary some devices in ME may need relatively high frequencies operating for a long period of time. In this work the mesoscopic effects in the SMA are quantified to ensure guaranteed behavior in the frame of dampers for CE applications. For instance, the actions of accumulated deformation in cycling and the changes induced by external temperature (i.e., summer-winter) are evaluated. Also, the perturbations induced by diffusive (induced by phase metastability, i.e. produced by microscopic interactions) are considered. In particular, the phase coexistence effects are visualized in Cu-based and partially in NiTi alloys. The practical creep induced by cycling and the coexistence actions are decisive in damping applications.},

Ageing of solution-annealed and water-quenched Ni-rich NiTi single crystals results in a homogeneous precipitation of coherent Ni4Ti3particles. When the interparticle spacing reaches a critical value (order of magnitude: 200 nm), three distinct transformation processes are observed on cooling from the high-temperature phase using differential scanning calorimetry and in situ transmission electron microscopy. The transformation sequence begins with the formation of R-phase starting from all precipitate/matrix interfaces (first step). The transformation continues with the formation of B19′ and its subsequent growth along all precipitate/matrix interfaces (second step). Finally, the matrix in between the precipitates transforms to B19′ (third step). Elementary transformation mechanisms which account for two- and three-step transformations in a system with small-scale microstructural heterogeneities were identified. © 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Mössbauer spectroscopy, AC-susceptibility and magnetization measurement results indicate that the FCC alloy displays two magnetic behaviors; a paramagnetic component that orders along over a wide temperature range below 220 K, and a minor antiferromagnetic fraction that is still ordered at room temperature. The average hyperfine field (Bhf=5.2T) and the isomer shift (δ = 0.07 mm/s) values at T= 23 K show that Fe atoms are in a FCC structure that includes Mn and Cu atoms.

Methane partial oxidation was studied over a Rh(1 wt.\%)@Al2O3catalyst, composed of Rh nanoparticles embedded in an Al2O3matrix, and the results were compared with those of a reference Rh(1 wt.\%)/Al2O3, obtained by incipient wetness impregnation procedure. The embedded catalyst was prepared by precipitation of Al(OH)3in the presence of stabilised Rh nanoparticles, followed by calcination. H2chemisorption data confirm the accessibility of most of the protected Rh nanoparticles. Both Rh catalysts are active for MPO, reaching complete CH4conversion above 1023 K. Notably, the embedded catalyst is more resistant to deactivation during consecutive run-up and steady state catalytic experiments. The protection offered by the surrounding layer of porous oxide prevents extensive sintering of the active metal phase, even after high temperature aging, as observed by high resolution TEM. Moreover, with respect to the standard impregnated sample, the embedded Rh(1 wt.\%)@Al2O3is more resistant towards the undesirable incorporation of Rh into the alumina under oxidising conditions. At 1023 K, stable MPO activity is observed for at least 60 h, after which slow deactivation starts, essentially by coke deposition. Treatment with O2restores the catalytic activity, while brief switches to O2during reaction prevent deactivation. Increasing the working temperature or the reactant concentration significantly reduces the effects of coke deactivation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The high frequency relaxation is interpreted as produced by a single relaxation process due to kink pair formation with kink diffusion in dislocation lines, but the low frequency relaxation must be considered as a more complicated process.},

  abstract = {The compression creep behaviour of Al-SiCfibermetal matrix composites (MMC), made by hot-pressing (HP), was evaluated at various temperatures and over several orders of magnitude of strain rates. The interpretation of metal flow-patterns during the whole deformation cycle was complex owing to the fact that the short-fibre distribution in the composites was roughly planar. However, every specimen showed a well-defined flow stress or plateau (σtruep) up to the end of the tests that were associated with nearly 50\% linear compression strains. Such stresses clearly increased with the volume fraction (f) of fibres and strain rates, and decreased with increasing temperatures. Cross-examination of the creep curves [log strain rate (γ̇) versus log shear stress (τ)] for both the HP Al matrix and composites show an apparent stress exponent nap= [δ (ln γ ̇)/δ (ln τ)] clearly increasing while decreasing τ. This anomalous behaviour can be attributed to the existence of a finite threshold stress (τ0) for every composition. This threshold stress appears to be related to the oxide contamination (judged from TEM observations) of the matrix, as a result of the use of powder metallurgy (PM) synthesis method. Following certain approximations during deformation behaviour of PM specimens reinforced with ceramic particles, the present data, for short-fibre reinforced MMC, seems to be consistent with the mechanism of dislocation climb that is characterized by an stress exponent of around five, and an activation energy close to that for self-diffusion in pure aluminum (143.2 kJ mol-1). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The pseudoelastic behavior of shape memory alloys is not an ideal process. We show how pull-pull cycling changes the pseudoelastic properties, resulting in a decrease of plateau stresses (characterizing the forward and reverse transformation) and an accumulation of irreversible strain (indicating the increase of dislocation density in the material and/or the increase of the volume fraction of stabilized martensite). Moreover, pseudoelasticity is only observed within a limited temperature window. In our case, optimum initial pseudoelasticity was obtained in a region of 10-80 °C. While all this is well appreciated, the fact that the evolution of the pseudoelastic behavior shows a strong temperature dependence even within this 'pseudoelastic window' has received much less attention. After 120 pseudoelastic cycles at temperatures between 28 °C and 80 °C, our material showed variations of the vertical width of stress-strain hysteresis and accumulated irreversible strain by factors of two and four, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In both cases the IF spectrum is composed by two peaks: P1 at 190 K and P2 at 290 K, with corresponding modulus variations. The P1 data are detected to be due to a thermally activated process which frequency shift activation energy is (0.175±0.004) eV and fitted to a relaxation peak with a larger wide respect to a Debye peak, being β equal to 2.2. It is interpreted to be due to the movement of misfit dislocations within the AB5intermetallic-type alloy particles in the presence of nearby H atoms, acting as a Cottrell atmosphere. Peak P2 is ascribed to the decomposition and formation of hydride phase in the alloy particles upon heating and cooling, respectively. The peak heights are shown to increase in the hydrided samples, supporting the above interpretation. These results are also discussed in connection with previous measurements on an electrode material prepared at the laboratory. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These mechanical properties were then correlated to the composition, precipitate distribution and, indirectly, to the vacancy concentration within these regions, as analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Using these results we constructed a structure-zone map of the area adjacent to the grain boundary, which relates the reduced elastic modulus and nanoindentation hardness of the alloy to its graded microstructure. Our analysis indicates that the lowest hardness was found in the region where no precipitates are present at all, regardless of solute concentration. In regions where precipitation is different from that of the bulk, somewhat inferior mechanical properties are achieved.},

  abstract = {Abstract The martensitic transformation is often accompanied by the production of defects either in the austenite, the martensite or in both phases. An interesting example of this is the generation of bulk dislocations and surface defects after pseudoelastic cycling in Cu-Zn-Al single crystals. The involved phases are the cubic (L21) of the austenite and the monoclinic 18R martensitic phase. The dislocations arrange in the bulk following crystallographic patterns associated to the habit plane of the transition and the basal plane of the martensite. A microscopic analysis shows that the dislocations are produced by plastic deformation of the martensite. These dislocations have several consequences on the mechanical behavior of the material and on the kinetics of the diffusional processes present in both phases. The formation of intrusions and extrusions at the surface specimens is another important effect of the pseudoelastic cycling. They play a crucial role on the fatigue life of the specimens. Recent results show a strong effect of composition on the nucleation of surface defects. The crystallography of the defects, the origin of the dislocations, their arrangements and their interaction with the specimen surface are discussed.},

  abstract = {The effects of the repeated stress-induced transformation (pseudoelastic fatigue) on the mechanical behaviour and microstructure of Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni single crystals are presented. Several microstructural changes occur during cycling at temperatures above the martensitic transformation temperature M-s in Cu-Zn-Al alloys. Bulk defects consisting of dislocation bands with retained martensite and intrusion-extrusion types of surface defects are observed. The fine characteristics of the defects, such as nucleation, density, as well as other microstructural features, depend on the working temperature, alloy composition, applied stresses and number of cycles. The presence of these defects alters the shape of the stress-strain curves in the pseudoelastic range for Cu-Zn-Al. Also diffusive phenomena strongly affect the mechanical behaviour of these alloys both in the parent and martensite phases, even for tests carried out slightly above room temperature. In turn, the kinetics of these diffusional processes has been found to depend on the density of bulk defects. Details of these processes are discussed and a simple model that describes the main characteristics of the mechanical behaviour evolution is considered. The interaction between the mechanical behaviour, density of defects and diffusion is discussed. In the case of Cu-Al-Ni, bulk defects are also shown to occur but the system is less prone to diffusion effects that could affect the mechanical behaviour. The defects generated during pseudoelastic cycling lead, however, to the inhibition of the gamma' phase when a transition between the bcc parent phase and a mixture of two martensitic structures gamma' (2H) and beta' (18R) is involved at the beginning of the cycling process.},

Previous 3 2/3 1 /3 work [1] showed that the modulus becomes higher while the internal friction has a peak at the transition temperature (T 5262 K). In this c work, improvements made on the equipment allowed us to measure at constant deformations ( ,10 ) and magnetic fields up to 4500 ´ 25 Gauss. We made isothermal measurements of internal friction, modulus and resistance as a function of an applied magnetic field. We found that most of the changes induced by the magnetic field take place in a few degrees (almost 5 K) near the transition temperature where the changes in resistance are more important. Up to the highest magnetic field applied, we found 3\% maximum variations of the modulus and no hysteresis while cycling the magnetic field.We suppose that the experiment is placed in the linear response of the inverse Wiedemann effect [2], due to the small deformations used, and that the ferromagnetic domain structure is responsible for the observed effects. Some additional measurements are needed (magnetic hysteresis loops) to be compared with our results.},

This ordering brings about a lattice distortion and a large hardening of the sound velocity below TCO.

In order to study the effects of this charge order melting, ultrasonic longitudinal sound velocity measurements were performed on polycrystalline Pr1-xCaxMnO3(x=0.35 and 0.5) as a function of magnetic field and temperature.

A solid solution and intermetallic compounds (IMCs) with high melting point form as layers almost free from defect, allowing service temperatures about 500 \&deg;C higher than the process temperature. The phase stability sequence starting from the Ni to the Cu interface is the following: \&alpha;\&prime;- Ni{$<$}inf{$>$}3{$<$}/inf{$>$}Ga, \&gamma;-Cu{$<$}inf{$>$}9{$<$}/inf{$>$}Ga{$<$}inf{$>$}4{$<$}/inf{$>$}, \&beta;-Cu{$<$}inf{$>$}3{$<$}/inf{$>$}Ga and (Cu) solid solution of the Ga-Cu system. The relative reaction front displacement of the layers and the implications of the present findings for the applicability of the diffusion-soldering method are also discussed. \&copy; 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

According to the EPMA, TEM/EDX and electron diffraction analyses, two different behaviors were observed in the interconnection zone depending on the temperature range: (i) a single layer consisting of η phase below 200 °C; (ii) a Cu-poor region consisting of η phase and a Cu-rich layer formed by a mixture of thin alternate regions of ζ-Cu10Sn3and δ-Cu7In3phases perpendicular to the interconnection plane above 200 °C. The η layer shows two morphologies: large grains and fine grains at the η/In-48Sn (liquid) and at the η/Cu-rich interfaces, respectively. Additionally, the η region shows a gradual change in composition, suggesting a change from the Cu6Sn5to the Cu2In structures.

This composite system is investigated for the first time by mechanical spectroscopy techniques in the temperature range between 50 K and 450 K (1 kHz) where large annealing effects and two damping phenomena are detected. The as-cast microstructure irreversibly changes during annealing above 330 K, leading to a large modulus recovery accompanied by a reduction in the internal friction level. A relatively large relaxation effect is observed about 290 K, evidenced by a narrow internal friction peak with the corresponding step in the elastic modulus; this peak remains stable under thermal cycling between 200 K and 300 K but is affected by aging at 330 K and practically vanishes after heating to 450 K. Another internal friction peak is observed at about 250 K which has associated an anomalous modulus effect; in this temperature range, the internal friction and the elastic modulus exhibit heating/cooling hysteresis, which strongly depends on the extreme temperatures of the thermal cycle, a behavior frequently associated to first-order phase transformations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized nanoparticles present an ellipsoidal shape with the major axis of approximately 170 nm and the minor axis that increases with the synthesis temperature from 30 to 70 nm. By magnetization and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, we have obtained the parameters that characterize the AFM nanoparticles system. We have found that the Néel temperature, TN, and the spin-flop field, HSF, increase with the particle size from TN =288 K and HSF (5 K) =10 kOe for the smaller nanoparticles and approach the bulk values [TN =308 K and HSF (5 K) =60 kOe] for the larger particles. From the experimental results and the molecular-field theory applied to AFM coupled sublattices, we estimated the magnetic anisotropy, K, and the molecular-field constant, λ, as a function of the Cr2 O3 nanoparticle size. When the size is reduced, λ only diminishes ∼8\% with respect to its bulk value (4.9× 104 Oe2 g/erg); instead, K decreases more than an order of magnitude from K=3.8× 104 to 8.7× 102 erg/g. We analyzed the results on the basis of a core shell model where the nanoparticle internal order consists of an antiferromagnetically ordered core and a disordered surface shell, which presents a frustrated magnetic state. ©2008 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {We have characterized the elevated temperature (190 °C) precipitation sequence near the grain boundaries of an AlCuSiGe alloy, comparing these results to the binary AlCu and the ternary AlSiGe. In the quaternary alloy, there is a graded microstructure that evolves with increasing distance from the boundaries, which is generally a superposition of the precipitate-free-zones (PFZs) in the binary AlCu and in the ternary AlSiGe. After aging for 3 h, this graded area consists of an approximately 140 nm wide region that is entirely precipitate free, followed by a 400 nm wide region that is denuded of Si-Ge and θ′ precipitates. Rather than containing the (Si-Ge)-θ′ pairs observed in the bulk, this 400 nm wide region contains only homogeneously nucleated θ″. Only in the overaged condition (144 h) are the near grain boundary θ″ replaced by a coarse distribution of large plate-like θ′. In the alloys, the solute depleted zones are much narrower than the total length of the PFZ. For example, in both AlCu and AlCuSiGe, the Cu depleted zone is only 30 nm wide. This underscores the need for vacancies during precipitation of not only θ′ and Si-Ge, but of θ″ as well. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

After the same artificial aging time, a larger density of S phase precipitates was obtained in the pre-deformed specimens. In non-deformed specimens, a high density of small nanometer-sized aggregates was found, that was absent in the pre-deformed specimens, that were identified as GP zones. To further analyze the small sized aggregates, artificially aged specimens with no previous deformation were also studied with Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) of positron annihilation radiation.

  abstract = {The particular properties of shape memory alloys (SMAs) are related to a martensitic transformation between metastable phases. Their applicability to dampers in civil engineering requires a fully guaranteed behaviour of the SMAs both on mesoscopic and atomic levels. The first one relates the thermomechanical properties (fracture, number of working cycles, summer–winter temperature effects and, for instance, self-heating associated with latent heat and the frictional work converted on heat) and the second one, the actions on the phase transition of the thermodynamic forces (temperature and stress). The properties of the CuAlBe alloy are explained and the characteristics of the NiTi alloy are outlined. By establishing an appropriate model the SMA dampers are introduced inside a structure and, via the ANSYS software, the dynamic response of the free and of the damped structure are obtained by simulation under the action of acceleration from the earthquakes available in the literature. As a conclusion, the conditions for the appropriateness of the dampers are given.},

  abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMA) are good candidates for solid state dampers because of their large recoverable strain and hysteresis. In this work, experimental analysis and modeling of the thermomechanical behavior for two SMAs is done. The SMA models are developed and included in a finite element simulation environment (ANSYS). Using these developing tools, a complete damping solution for a family house is outlined. The paper presents the design and optimization methodology for the dampers, analyzes their performance, and quantifies the relevant physical effects from the experimental measurements. The simulation results show that the SMA dampers are capable of reducing the maximum oscillation amplitude induced by "El Centro" accelerations by a factor 2 and that they dissipate 50\% of the energy transmitted to the structure. Furthermore, SMA dampers constitute a passive, unsupervised damping solution appropriate for family houses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper the formation of hexagonal precipitates is studied with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It is shown that the precipitates do not have a homogeneous structure.

  abstract = {Experiments have been performed in Cu-Zn-Al single crystals in order to further understand the evolution of material properties after continuous pseudoelastic cycling. In a fatigue experiment of this type, permanent and recoverable effects are observed for temperatures above 273 K. Experiments in the stress-strain-time space have been designed in order to separate both contributions. The occurrence of recoverable changes can be related to the ordering of the beta-phase and to the stabilization of the martensite, both depending in turn on the atomic diffusion phenomena in these alloys above 273 K. The kinetics of these processes show a considerable increase of the associated time constant after the pseudoelastic cycling procedure. The relation of these changes with the microstructural evolution of the material is analyzed and a discussion is offered on the role that each mechanism, either diffusive or due to microstructural changes, plays on fatigue. The relevance of defining a reference state in order to determine the consequences of pseudoelastic cycling is shown. A model which considers the stabilization of martensite and the beta recovery has been used to reproduce the stress deformation behavior after cycling. An enhancement of stabilization kinetics during fatigue has allowed us to obtain a closer fit with the experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Strain-controlled experiments were performed using incremental strain steps and different constant maximum strains. Pull-pull cycling results in decreasing/increasing plateau stresses characterizing the forward/reverse transformations and an accumulation of non-recoverable strain. Saturation is reached after 30 cycles. We interpret our results in terms of a microstructural scenario where dislocations, which are introduced during the martensitic transformation (lattice invariant shear) and during pull-pull cycling (dislocation plasticity), interact with the stress-induced formation of martensite. We show that the slopes of stress-strain curves naturally depend on the total strain imposed in strain-controlled testing. We also provide a dislocation-based explanation for the evolving stress levels of the loading and unloading plateaus during pseudoelastic cycling. And most importantly, we show how dislocations act as microstructural markers which allow the material to remember its previous stress-strain history.},

Procedures published in the literature which yield natural stress exponents and threshold stresses which decrease with increasing temperature were reproduced; however, threshold values corresponding to natural stress exponents cannot be physically justified. The procedures considered in this paper yielded no precise results. Several combinations of stress exponents/threshold values and activation energies are shown to satisfy the procedural requirements.

This evolution is strong during early cycling. It is generally assumed that these effects, which saturate after about a hundred cycles, are associated with the elementary processes which govern dislocation plasticity and stress-induced martensitic transformations. Dislocations can do both, stabilize martensite (through their stress fields) and contribute to accumulation of irreversible strain. While it is accepted that dislocations may alter the cyclic stress-strain behavior during stress-induced martensitic transformations in NiTi, it is generally assumed that atomic reordering processes (which are known to significantly affect martensitic transformations in Cu-base shape memory alloys) play no role. In the present investigation we show that hold times in saturated stress-strain cycles show significant effects which are smaller than, but similar in type to those in Cu-base alloys.

The addition of a third element like Pd, Pt or Hf increases the transformation temperature. It is already reported that the substitution of Pd for Ni can increase the transformation temperatures of Ti-Ni from approximately room temperature to 800 K [7]. The phase transformation characteristics within the Ti-Ni-Pd system were recently investigated by combinatorial materials science methods [8]. For the first time the complete composition region showing a reversible phase transformation was determined. For non-transforming compositions, e.g. Ti64Ni20Pd16, X-ray diffraction results showed pronounced amounts of Ti2Pd and Ti2Ni precipitates. However the mechanism of how the precipitates might hinder the phase transformation could not be deduced. Therefore a TEM sample of Ti64Ni20Pd16 was cut form the Ti-Ni-Pd composition spread by target preparation methods using a focused ion beam (FIB) system with attached energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.},

In this work, the effects produced by swift heavy ions on the martensitic 18R structure of Cu-Zn-Al alloy (Cu - 12.17 Zn - 17.92 Al, in \%at) were analyzed. Crystalline samples were irradiated in a direction close to the [2 1 0] of 18R with Xe+ 230 MeV, Au+ of 350 MeV and Kr+ of 200 MeV ion beams. Defects of the order of nanometers induced by the irradiation were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM). It was also observed, that the average size of the irradiation defects induced by Au+ ion is larger than those induced by Xe+ and Kr+ ions.

  abstract = {The influence of ion irradiation on the formation of γ phase precipitates and the degree of long-range order was studied in β-Cu-Zn-Al-Ni alloys. Single crystals of β-Cu-Zn-Al-Ni and β-Cu-Zn-Al with surfaces close to (1 over(1, ̄) 0)βwere irradiated simultaneously at normal incidence with 300 keV Cu ions at room temperature. The microstructural changes of both alloys, investigated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were compared. The formation of the γ phase in quaternary Cu-Zn-Al-Ni, induced by room temperature irradiation, was observed for the first time. Irradiation was not able to completely destroy first neighbor and second neighbor ordering in the quaternary alloy. The observed behavior under irradiation was compared to that of thermal treatments. The presence of γ phase precipitates in ion irradiated Cu-Zn-Al-Ni alloy is discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The effects produced by swift heavy ions in the martensitic (18R) and austenitic phase (beta) of Cu based shape memory alloys were characterized. Single crystal samples with a surface normal close to [210](18R) and [001](beta) were irradiated with 200 MeV of Kr(15+), 230 MeV of Xe(15+), 350 and 600 MeV of Au(26+) and Au(29+). Changes in the microstructure were studied with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was found that swift heavy ion irradiation induced nanometer sized defects in the 18R martensitic phase. In contrast, a hexagonal close-packed phase formed on the irradiated surface of beta phase samples. HRTEM images of the nanometer sized defects observed in the 18R martensitic phase were compared with computer simulated images in order to interpret the origin of the observed contrast. The best agreement was obtained when the defects were assumed to consist of local composition modulations.},

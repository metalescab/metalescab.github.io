  abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures comprising Au and ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by the spontaneous reduction of HAuCl4 in ethylene glycol were used to assess the possibility of modulating the direction of the electron transfer processes at the interface. One electron UV reduction and visible oxidation of the reversible couple TEMPOL/TEMPOL-H was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. The apparent quantum yield for TEMPOL-H conversion under continuous wave visible excitation depends on the irradiation wavelength, being 0.57\% and 0.27\% at 450 +/- 12 and 530 +/- 12 nm, respectively. These results indicate that both the surface plasmon resonance and the interband transition from the 5d to the 6s level of Au nanoparticles contribute to the visible activity of the nanostructure. In addition, by detecting free electron conduction band electrons in ZnO, after the visible excitation of Au/ZnO nanostructures, we provide direct evidence of the photoexcited electron transfer from gold nanoparticles to ZnO.},

Existing experimental data for the temperature and strain rate dependence of the shear stress at which the relevant deformation mechanism begins are analyzed. It is shown that the data for cross slip in fee metals, for prismatic slip, and for slip in bee metals can be described by an Arrhenius equation with an activation energy that is proportional to the logarithm of the stress. Stacking fault energies are determined from the strain rate sensitivity of the shear stress.},

The stacking fault energy would be essentially the same as for the disordered alpha-phase, but is reduced due to an additional lattice distortion which depends on the ordering energy of the fc.t. lattice. In the 2 H martensite with a stacking fault on each second plane, the stacking faults interact, leading to a small increase in energy. Thus, in these ordered martensites the stacking fault energy depends not only on the composition, but also on the ordering energy and on the lattice distortion associated with it. These observations can be relevant to understand the dislocation mobility in other fc.t. long-range ordered alloys.},

Due to the diffusionless nature of the martensitic transformation the configurational entropy remains invariant and the entropy difference results mainly from differences in the phonon spectra, which are accessible to experiment, especially the soft branches. From measured enthalpy differences in the long range ordered alloys, those corresponding to the disordered state can be deduced which, together with the vibrational entropy differences, provide also valuable information on the equilibrium phases. Close packed materials with different stacking sequences are commonly observed, and from the critical transformation stresses their relative stability can be assessed. Split dislocations in long range ordered alloys with a stacking fault between them are similar to a thin martensite region, and therefore a comparison between both is of interest.},

  abstract = {Results from martensitic transformations are used to evaluate stabilities of the equilibrium phases in the Hume-Rothery electron compounds based on Cu, Ag and Au, and to give arguments why the electron concentration plays such an important role in the selection of the crystal structures. It is shown that the vibrational entropy difference observed for the martensitic transformation from ordered bcc to the close packed martensite and its e/a dependence can also account for the entropy difference ΔSα/β between the equilibrium α and β at high temperatures, and can be made largely responsible for the composition dependence of the (α+β) two phase field. The enthalpy of mixing can be decomposed into a small term which depends on the average periodic lattice, which is different in α and β but which is nearly the same in all alloys studied, and a contribution which is due to the difference in the properties of the atoms and which can be expressed by pair interchange energies. This contribution depends strongly on the specific alloy system, but is independent of structure, which is compatible with a pair interchange energy depending only on pair distance but not on structure, as suggested by simple pseudopotential theory. The same pair interchange energies account also for long range order and the critical ordering temperature. The evaluation for several alloy systems shows a surprisingly good agreement within this picture, and permits to understand better why the electron concentration plays such an important role also for other structures, although the energy contribution of the conduction electrons is only a small part of the total enthalpy of formation of any of the equilibrium structures. © 1996 Springer-Verlag.},

It is of importance to understand in which way the coordinated movement of atoms occurs during the transformation. This topic will be discussed for the transformation from the body centered long-range ordered structure to the face centered or hexagonal one, as is observed in many noble metal alloys. Also the transformation in the iron alloys from the face centered austenite to the body centered or hexagonal martensite will be dealt with. The transformation takes place only when the martensite becomes more stable thermodynamically. The factors that control the stability will be evaluated for the noble metal alloys, especially the Cu-Zn-Al alloys which have been studied extensively at the Centro Atómico Bariloche. Since the alloys possess long-range order, the influence of order on the phase stability is analyzed. As will be shown, long-range order is also decisive to obtain alloys with a small hysteresis between transformation and retransformation, which is the basis for the superelastic and shape memory behavior.},

The two requirements, namely that the correct martensitic crystal structure results, and in addition that an undistorted interface between the matrix and the martensite is necessary, lead in general to more than one shear system. As will be discussed, the selection of the shear systems to comply with the transformation crystallography underlies the same selection principles as deformation by slip. Three examples are presented: the Cu–Zn based noble metal alloys, the Ni–Ti based ones and the Fe alloys. Whereas plastic deformation is induced by applied stresses, the martensitic transformation is controlled by a change in Gibbs free energy, but can be modified by applying stresses. The creation of transformation strains leads to an interaction with applied stresses. The different types of interaction between applied stress, transformation strain and associated plastic deformation are discussed for the three alloy groups.},

The transformation mechanism: How does the martensite phase nucleate and grow within the matrix phase, taking into account that diffusional processes are absent, but that nevertheless large shape changes occur. 2. The influence of the transformation mechanism on the selection of the martensite structures. 3. The relationship between the stability of the martensite and of the equilibrium phases that are obtained when diffusion is permitted. In this paper mainly the first aspect will be discussed, using as prototypes the Cu based noble metal shape memory alloys with a transformation from a bcc based lattice to a close packed one, and the Fe-Pt alloys with the transformation from fcc to bcc. It will be shown that the atom movements during the transformation can be described by a combination of two shears, with the possible exception of the bcc to hexagonal transformation. Arguments are presented to substantiate this mechanism. It also permits to discuss the factors which control the energy dissipation during these shears and thus determine the hysteresis between the transformation and the retransformation. It is suggested that in order to get a good shape memory effect with little hysteresis it is necessary to have a long range ordered matrix.},

We calculate the screening length λ using Thomas-Fermi theory, a slave-boson treatment of correlations and experimental data.

This model assumes that any two O ions of the CuOx planes repel each other with a screened Coulomb interaction, but the repulsion between second-neighbour O ions with a Cu ion in between is reduced by a factor f. The value of f was calculated using the extended Hubbard Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit. For large screening length λ, R=Y and x=38 the predictions of the model are in excellent agreement with recent neutron measurements. Assuming that λ decreases strongly in the metallic phase, all previously observed diffraction patterns for R=Y can also be explained (x=18, 12, 47, 35, 58, 23, 34 and 78). We conclude that CuO chains can be observed almost exclusively in the metallic phase and predict superstructures that should be observed in semiconducting materials, in particular when x≥12 and the ionic radius of R3+ is larger than that of Y3+.},

Under certain circumstances, this term is the dominant one and phase separation is favored. Here we consider the specific case of different two-dimensional lattice-gas models of O ordering in RBa2Cu3O6+x (R = Y, rare earths) in the regime of compositions and parameters for which the O atoms are ordered in infinite Cu-O chains at temperature T = 0. When a phenomenological term that takes into account the dependence of the lattice parameter c on the O content x is added to G, phase separation with two broad two-phase fields takes place at T⪷400 K in the asymmetric next-nearest neighbor Ising (ASYNNNI) model. If instead any two O ions interact via a screened Coulomb repulsion, and c is kept fixed, we obtain further evidence of the existence of a complete devil's staircase at T = 0. However, when c is relaxed, for any finite screening length only a finite number of phases are stable at T = 0 and phase separation also occurs at low enough temperatures.},

The effect of thermomechanical treatments in Cu-Zn-Al samples with different surface orientation is also studied. Relevant changes in a mixed hysteresis cycle (Cu-Al-Ni polycrystal with two martensite phases) are observed in annealing treatments. On the other hand, observation of the interfaces movement in reduced thermal cycling establishes the temperature scale and the geometrical conditions to obtain a repetitive/recoverable hysteresis cycle},

  abstract = {The angular distributions of protons travelling through thin polycrystalline gold targets (∼ 15 nm) with incident energies in the range of 4-10 keV have been measured. The results confirm previous experiments at higher energies showing deviations from theoretical predictions based on the standard multiple scattering theory. In order to prove that the effect of crystal structure is one of the main causes of these deviations we have performed numerical simulations. To simulate the polycrystalline structure in a realistic way, we have made an analysis of the target by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Including these characteristics in the simulation, together with the effect of vibrations and crystal disorder we analyzed the corresponding angular distribution. To evaluate the role of channeling, we also measured angular distributions of protons in a 〈100〉 gold foil and made the corresponding numerical simulations. The results show the critical influence of the target structure in the angular spectra of transmitted ions. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  \&  Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

  abstract = {A detailed characterization of electrodeposited NiW coatings prepared by pulse electrodeposition on steel and copper substrates is presented. The coatings were obtained at high current pulse frequency and show high microhardness and absence of brittleness. The surface of the coating consists of nanometer sized crystals forming a cauliflower-like structure protected by a mixture of nickel and tungsten oxides. The cauliflower structure is preserved into the bulk coating that exhibits an average composition ≈70 at\% Ni30 at\% W. Different phases are observed in the bulk structure: a W-rich amorphous phase (≈40\%) and Ni-rich crystalline phases (≈60\%). The crystalline phases consist of crystalline domains ≈7 nm in size of Ni(W) (fcc) solid solution (12 at\% W content) and a minor Ni4W component (less than 10\%). The amorphous phase exhibits a less compact NiW structure where some amount of C could also be present. Oxidized W species cannot be detected in the bulk coating, thus discarding the presence of significant amounts of tungsten carbide, tungstates or citrate-tungsten complexes. Our results shed light on controversial points related to the chemical composition and demonstrate the complex structure of this system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles Pt/C (NPs) are used in many fields of science. These kinds of materials have been extensively studied in electrochemistry due to the fact that they are applied in fuel cell technology. Although there are a myriad of methods for Pt NP synthesis, the need for obtaining Pt/C NPs with a good dispersion (covering over the entire support), a narrow size distribution, and clean surface (among other parameters) is far to be overcome. On this sense herein we describe a very easy and quick method of synthesis of highly dispersed Pt NPs followed by a simple electrochemical cleaning step. The catalysts were electrochemically characterized by studying their behavior in 0.5 M H2SO4 and also by using CO as a probe during the CO electro-oxidation reaction (COEOR). This paper shows how to obtain highly dispersed and clean Pt/C NPs that produce very reproducible results. Besides, we demonstrate how the presence of impurities negatively affects the electrochemical reproducibility of Pt NPs with a clear impact on their catalytic activity.

The results demonstrated that Au(III) ions were bound to oat biomass in a pH-dependent manner, with the highest adsorption (about 80\%) at pH 3.

The excess vacancy concentration which controls the diffusion velocity has been monitored by different heat treatments: (a) a slow air cooling and aging in the austenite prior to the transformation, leading to a low vacancy concentration; (b) a quench from 800°C; and (c) a quench from 300°C with an increase in the excess vacancies. The TWME has also been studied at low temperatures where diffusion is absent. All these results show that in Cu–Zn–Al polycrystals, diffusion has little or no influence on the TWME, and that instead a spectrum of martensite plate configurations is created by the stress, which then serve as nuclei for the subsequent transformation without an applied stress. The TWME obtained in the polycrystals is in all cases lower than that in single crystals after the stabilization of the stress induced martensite variant.},

To achieve the SMA as a guaranteed material for damping of structures requires a reliability study of the static and dynamic properties adapted to each type of application. Here we present static (temperature and time effects) and dynamic actions in pseudo-elastic NiTi SMA. We concern with long time effects of temperature and time mainly in beta phase. NiTi results are presented, including measurements of electrical resistance as a function of temperature and time, DSC to −80°C (TA Instruments), non-conventional conduction calorimetry (to 80 K), and several X-ray diffraction spectra at different temperatures. Diffusion effects are present, and all the measurements show that transformation temperatures change with time of aging even at moderate temperatures (i.e., near 100°C), depending on time and temperature. It is possible to visualize the diffusion change in the R phase transformation via classical X-ray characterization. We include some results of pre-stressing effects applying the stress at different zones of the hysteresis cycle. The experimental analysis shows that coupling between stress and temperature enhances the changes. For long times (10, 20 years) and direct sunny actions, more deep analysis is required. Finally, some dynamic effects in cycling affecting the SMA creep are outlined.},

In alloys of Ti, Zr and Hf with other TMs, the Ω phase can be formed and retained metastably at room temperature by quenching the bcc structure, which is usually the stable high-temperature phase in these alloy systems. As a part of a systematic investigation of the structural and bonding properties of the bcc and Ω phases, and of the bcc → Ω phase transformation in TMs and alloys, we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the structural relations between these phases in Ti, Zr, Hf and in other TMs. The approach is as follows. First, we establish the most general geometrical relations connecting the lattice parameters and interatomic distances (IDs) of the bcc and Ω structures. Next, we focus on the ratio between the relevant IDs of these phases, which are assessed on the basis of an extensive database with experimental and theoretical information. Both stable and metastable structures are considered, and various remarkable regularities in ID ratios are discussed. Finally, in the light of the systematics of ID ratios established in the present work, a discussion is made of the probable lattice parameters for the Ω phase of Hf, which are not yet accurately known from direct measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with (i) the establishment of Pauling's bond length vs. bond number relation (BLBNR) for Ti, Zr and Hf, and (ii) the analysis of the connections between the parameters entering into the BLBNR and the experimental interatomic distances (IDs) in the known solid phases of these elements. Recently assessed ID data on the hcp structure, which is the stable phase at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (RTAP) as well as on the bcc and omega (Ω) structures, which are metastable at RTAP, are treated in terms of the BLBNR, and various approaches are tested for the evaluation of the univalent metallic bond-length parameter, D(1), of Ti, Zr and Hf. Next, a comparison is made with Pauling's method, which is based on determining an optimum D(1) parameter. With these results, a new interpretation is presented of the so-called Jamieson correlation, which involves the possibility of a connection between D(1) and the shortest ID in the Ω phase. Finally, the BLBNR is applied to the metastable fcc structure of Ti, Zr and Hf, and a new evaluation is performed of the difference between metallic bond lengths for coordination numbers 12 (D(12)) and 8 (D(8)), which is compared with early generalizations on D(12)-D(8).},

  abstract = {The lattice parameters of the bcc (b) and omega (W) phases occurring metastably in a series of Zr-rich Zr-Nb alloys have been determined at and above room temperature (TR) using neutron diffraction techniques. In the first place, the effect of temperature changes upon the lattice parameters of the b and W phases in alloys with 10 and 18 at.\% Nb was monitored using neutron thermodiffraction. A method of analysis is applied to the data which involves a confrontation between the observed structural properties and an idealised -or ``reference'- behaviour (RB) which admits a simple mathematical description. A generalised form of Vegard's law is adopted as RB for the b phase, whereas a specific RB is proposed for the W structure. The experimental data are well accounted for by this interpretation scheme, leading to a picture of the isothermal reactions occurring at high temperature which involves the transfer of Nb from the W to the b phase. Finally, the neutron diffraction data on the W phase are combined with an electron microscopy study for the alloy with 10 at.\% Nb aged at 773 K, which provides information on the composition of this phase and its evolution towards thermodynamic equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The name omega (Ω) phase refers to a high-pressure modification of the transition metals (TMs) Ti, Zr, and Hf. In alloys of Ti, Zr and Hf with other TMs, the Ω phase can be formed and retained metastably at room temperature by quenching the bcc structure, which is usually the stable high-temperature phase in these alloy systems. As a part of a long-term research program on the structural and bonding properties of TM phases, we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the shortest interatomic distances (SIDs) of the stable and metastable bcc and Ω structures of the 3d, 4d and 5d TMs, as well as the connections between these and the single-bond length D(1) entering into Pauling’s classical bond length vs. bond number relation (BLBNR). The analysis involves an extensive database including experimental data, very recent ab initio calculations, and new predictions based on the BLBNR for the bcc phase of the TMs. Our results lend support to early suggestions by Jamieson of the existence of a correlation between D(1) and the SID of the Ω phase of Ti and Zr. We also find that, for most TMs, D(1) and the SID of the Ω structure differ by less than about 2\%, which implies that the Jamieson correlation might be considered as a reasonably accurate first approximation in estimating IDs and lattice parameters for unknown Ω phases of the TMs.},

  abstract = {This article presents an experimental study and a systematic phenomenological analysis of the structural properties and the high-temperature reactions of the Ω phase formed by quenching ('q') bcc (β) Zr-Nb alloys. In the first part of the work an extensive database with lattice parameters (LPs) for the Ωqand the untransformed βqphase is developed on the basis of neutron diffraction measurements. Various striking features of the LP vs. composition relations are detected, and a new method of analysis is applied which involves the concept of a 'reference behavior' (RB) describing the probable properties of each individual phase if it were unaffected by the other structures in the heterogeneous alloys. In this way, a detailed evaluation is performed of the effects of Ωq/βqcoherence strains upon the LPs of these two phases. In the second part of the work, neutron thermodiffraction studies are reported of the structural properties of the Ωq+ βqtwo-phase alloys at 300 K ≤ T ≤ 650 K. Extensive LP vs. time results are discussed. On this basis, the structural properties of the Ωaphase formed isothermally upon aging ('a') are established, and compared with those of the Ωqphase. In addition, new information is discussed on the evolution of the Ωa+ βasystem toward thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, it is shown how the present method of analysis may also be used to obtain indirect information of both theoretical and practical interest. In particular, considerable evidence is presented indicating that the Nb content of the Ωaphase decreases upon aging whereas that of βaincreases. Finally, it is shown how these composition changes might be used to reconcile much of the long-standing conflicting reports concerning the structural properties of the Ωqand Ωametastable phases. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For metallic systems (conducting sample), it is expected that the greatest contribution to the damage comes from knock-on displacement, but radiolysis is the most probable radiation damage mechanism for organic samples. The radiation damage of the electron beam produces huge changes in AuNPs’ structure, leading to coalescence of the Au cores when their \{100\} surfaces are facing each other. The complete coalescence process involve thiol desoprtion, AuNPs’ reorientation, and surface diffusion of Au adatoms, which produce the oriented attachment of the Au cores. The knock-on displacement cannot explain by itself the time taken by the entire process. Through a rigorous analysis, we rationalize the results considering that because of the small size of AuNPs they have a lower electron density than the bulk material which favors radiolytic damage.},

Results show that TMA is adsorbed on the Au(111) surface as thiolate species with a small amount of atomic sulfur (∼10\%) and a surface coverage lower than that found for alkanethiols due to steric factors. The amount of atomic sulfur markedly increases when the TMA is adsorbed on AuNPs by the ligand exchange method. We propose that the atomic sulfur is produced as a consequence of C−S bond cleavage, a process that is more favorable at defective sites of the AuNPs surface. The bond scission is also assisted by the presence of the electron-withdrawing carboxy moiety in the α- position relative to the C−S bond. Moreover, the high local concentration of positively charged species increases the stability of the negatively charged leaving group, leading to a higher amount of coadsorbed atomic sulfur. Our results demonstrate that the terminal functionalities of thiols are conditioning factors in the final structure and composition of the adlayers. ■},

  abstract = {Bulk Al-Al2O3metal matrix composites (MMCs) named HITEMAL (high temperature aluminum) were fabricated in situ by forging compaction of five different types of gas-atomized commercial purity Al powders with a mean particle size in the range of 1-9μm. As-forged HITEMAL consisted of (sub)micrometric Al grains (matrix) decorated with nanometric thick amorphous Al2O3(a-Al2O3) skeleton. Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) free of Al2O3were located in the Al grain interior. The Al grain size and the portion of LAGBs increased with the increase in the relative powder surface area. As-forged HITEMAL shows excellent thermal stability up to 400°C for 24h. Annealing at temperatures ≥450°C led to crystallization and morphological transformation from a-Al2O3skeleton to nanometric γ-Al2O3particles. Owing to the pinning effect of Al2O3phase, no Al grain growth took place during annealing up to 500°C. HITEMAL showed attractive mechanical properties especially when tested at 300°C (yield strength up to 220MPa, Young's modulus up to 58GPa). Despite the presence of a nearly continuous a-Al2O3skeleton along adjacent Al grains, forged HITEMAL materials had reasonable room temperature elongation of 7-26\%. HITEMAL's elongation decreased as the Al grain size decreased and with increased testing temperature. The loss in elongation (uniform and total) was attributed to the inhomogeneous flow, which occurred due to high densities of high angle grain boundaries (dislocation sinks) and small content of LAGBs. The strength of HITEMAL stemmed from grain boundary mediated strengthening mechanisms. The results showed a positive deviation from the Hall-Petch plot, which is typical behavior of ultrafine-grained metals. Transformation of a-Al2O3skeleton to γ-Al2O3particles led to deterioration of the HITEMAL strength and Young's modulus. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In a previous study of the effect of thermal cycling (TC) upon the fcc/hcp martensitic transformation (MT) in the binary system Fe-Mn, we evaluated the so-called resistance-to-start-the-transformation energy (RSTE) by applying models for the Gibbs energy of the fcc and hcp phases, and found a well defined pattern of variation as a function of the number of phase transformation cycles. In the first few cycles, the so-called promotion effects upon the MT were observed, but in the following cycles inhibition effects were predominant. In the presented work we further explore the applicability of our previous generalizations, by focusing on a ternary system: the Fe-Mn-Co system. We show that Co additions do not modify the pattern of variation of the RSTEs with the number of cycles. The effect of inducing plastic deformation (PD) of the fcc phase on the MT temperatures is also studied and compared with the effect of TC. The inhibition effect caused by PD is qualitatively the same as that of TC, as hypothesized in our previous work.},

  abstract = {Fe-Mn-Si-based alloys have been promising systems for shape memory applications for a long time. However, the need of a complicated training process in order to get the desired properties avoided their practical use. Recently, several new Fe-Mn-Si-based alloys, with interesting properties, containing different types of precipitates have been developed. In these new systems, the shape memory improvement is obtained either by the sole introduction of precipitates, or by the combination of a simple thermomechanical treatment followed by a subsequent precipitation. In this work, we investigate the effect of a thermomechanical treatment performed at a temperature of 870 K on the shape memory properties of an Fe-28Mn-6Si-5Cr (wt.\%). We have found that a simple treatment, without the necessity of introducing precipitates, is enough to obtain good shape memory properties. Transmission electron microscopy shows that a large density of stacking faults is produced during the treatment. From these observations we deduce that this large stacking fault density is clearly related to the observed properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is shown that the TC introduces dislocations mainly in the fee phase, which explains why the observed effects of TC upon the M-s and A(s) temperatures are qualitatively similar to those of plastic deformation of the austenite phase. Measurements of the M-s and A(s) as a function of the number of cycles reveal first a promotion effect and then an inhibition effect, which were explained in the first part of this study by Baruj et al. (1996, Z. Metallkde., 87, 765) by invoking the interplay between stacking faults and total dislocations.

It is shown that grinding lines remaining from the sample preparation process act as nucleation centers for the alpha (fcc) phase. Under this surface preparation conditions the new fcc phase nucleates with a different geometry than the one reported in previous papers in which surfaces were finished by electropolishing. In the present case, we observe individual fcc precipitates with a well defined geometry. The typical size of precipitates is in the micron range, and depends on the dezincification parameters: final temperature, dezincification time and prior surface preparation.

Such feature, which should in principle be observed in other, related Ω phases, has not yet been tested against direct measurements. This problem has now been studied in the Ti-V system, which is the analogue of Zr-Nb in the 3d-transition series. Neutron diffraction measurements have been performed in quenched Ti-V alloys with V contents between 14 and 17 at.\%. The diffraction spectra have been analysed using the Rietveld method, and a systematic analysis is reported here of the possibility of deviations from the random occupation of the two sublattices which are distinguished in the Ω structure.

Upon quenching, two additional structures are formed and retained metastably, viz. the hcp (alpha') phase, which forms through a martensitic transformation, and the omega (omega) phase, which forms by a displacive transformation involving the collapse of (111)(bcc) planes. The lattice parameters (LPs) of the beta, alpha' and omega phases are determined as functions of the Nb content in the composition interval 4 less than or equal to at.\% Nb less than or equal to 31, which represents a significant expansion of the experimental database for these various metastable structures. With the present data, reliable trends in the composition dependence of the LPs are established. In general, a smooth, essentially linear dependence upon the Nb content is detected, corresponding to Vegard's law. However, a striking deviation from this simple behaviour is detected in the a(omega) parameter for Zr-rich alloys, i.e. in the region where this LP is directly related to the shortest interatomic distance (LD) in the omega phase. The need for a new analysis of the composition dependence of the various IDs in the omega phase is emphasized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

The analysis is based on the database with lattice parameter (LP) measurements developed by Benites et al. using a neutron diffraction technique, which was reported in paper I of this series. Alloys with Nb contents between 4 at.\% and 31 at.\% are considered. Deviations from Vegard's-law type of behaviour in the variation of the atomic volume of the ω phase with the at.\% Nb are discussed, which are related to the peculiar behaviour of the a\$-ω/ LP of this phase in a narrow composition range, close to pure Zr. The LPs, together with other relevant structural data, are used to establish and analyse the composition dependence of the key IDs of the various metastable phases. In particular, the behaviour of the shortest ID (SID) of the ω phase is investigated in detail. We find that the SID values for the ω phase formed in the composition range 0≤at.\% Nb≤10 are even smaller than Pauling's single bond-length for Zr, a quantity which is involved in the so-called Jamieson correlation for the ω phase in elements and alloys. On the basis of the present results, a new picture of the effect of alloying upon the SID of the ω phase is proposed, which extends and refines previous ideas by Grad et al. [G.B. Grad, A.

In the present work, J-resistance curves of Inconel 690 and Incoloy 800 nuclear steam generator tubes with circumferential and longitudinal through wall cracks were obtained at room temperature and 300 °C using recently developed non-standard specimens' geometries. It was found that Incoloy 800 tubes exhibited higher J-resistance curves than Inconel 690 for both crack orientations. For both materials, circumferential cracks resulted into higher fracture resistance than longitudinal cracks, indicating a certain degree of texture anisotropy introduced by the tube fabrication process.

The results obtained in the present work provide a general framework for further application to structural integrity assessments of cracked tubes in a variety of nuclear steam generator designs.},

Diverse failure prediction methodologies were proposed in the past to ensure tube integrity by fulfilling regulatory authorities’ requirements. They have lead however to overly conservative plugging or repairing criteria like the so-called “40\% criterion”. In the present work, in line with modern approaches, an alternative more realistic methodology based on the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) is proposed. With that purpose, different studies available in the literature dealing with the experimental determination of fracture toughness of SGT materials were firstly reviewed. Using the results reported in these researches, the FAD was used for predicting the failure modes (i.e., ductile fracture or plastic collapse) of defective SGTs for varied crack geometries and loading conditions. The present analysis indicates the potentiality of the FAD as a comprehensive methodology for predicting the failure loads and failure modes of flawed SGTs.},

  abstract = {The assessment of the structural integrity of steam generator (SG) tubes in nuclear power plants deserved increasing attention in the last years due to the negative impact related to their failures. In this context, elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) methodology appears as a potential tool for the analysis. The application of EPFM requires, necessarily, knowledge of two aspects, i.e., the driving force estimation in terms of an elastic plastic toughness parameter (e.g., J) and the experimental measurement of the fracture toughness of the material (e.g., the material J-resistance curve). The present work describes the development of a non standardized experimental technique aimed to determine J-resistance curves for SG tubes with circumferential through wall cracks (TWCs). The tubes were made of Incoloy 800 (Ni: 30.0-35.0; Cr: 19.0-23.0; Fe: 35.5min, \% in weight). Due to its austenitic microstructure, this alloy shows very high toughness and is widely used in applications where a good corrosion resistance in aqueous environment or an excellent oxidation resistance in high temperature environment is required.},

They have been found susceptible to diverse degradation mechanisms during service. Due to the significance of a SGT failure on the plant safe operation, nuclear regulatory authorities have established tube plugging or repairing criteria which are based on the defect depth. The widespreadly used "40\% criterion" proposed in the 70s is an example whose use is still recommended in the last editions of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. In the present work, an alternative, more realistic and less conservative methodology for SGT integrity evaluation is proposed. It is based on the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) and takes advantage of the recent developments in non-destructive techniques which allow a more comprehensive characterization of tube defects, i.e., depth, length, orientation and type. The proposed approach has been applied to: the study of the influence of primary and secondary stresses on tube integrity; the prediction of failure mode (i.e., ductile fracture or plastic collapse) of defective SGTs for varied crack geometries and loading conditions; the analysis of the sensibility of tensile and fracture properties with temperature. The potentiality of the FAD as a comprehensive methodology for predicting the failure loads and failure modes of flawed SGTs is highlighted.},

This paper reports an analysis of the systematics of cohesive properties and equation-of-state parameters for a large number of stable, metastable and hypothetical binary Me a X b  type phases formed by Me~=~Cu, Ni with X~=~In, Sn. To this aim, an ab initio database previously developed by the authors using spin polarized density-functional-theory calculations, using the VASP code, is adopted. The work involves the volume (V 0 ), Wigner–Seitz radius, bulk modulus (B 0 ) and cohesive energy (E coh ) of the phases. At the outset of the paper it is shown that these properties can be studied as functions of the average group number (AGN), i.e., the weighted average of the number of valence electrons involved in the VASP calculations. Moreover, the cohesive energy density (CED), defined as E coh /V 0 , is shown to correlate very well with the AGN variable and with B 0 . These striking regularities are given two complementary interpretations. First, a general microscopic picture of the variations of cohesion is developed by studying the evolution of the contributions of the d- and p-electrons to their electronic density of states. In this way the effects of the hybridization of d- and p-electrons, and the filling up of bonding and anti-bonding states is highlighted. Next, a thermodynamic analysis based on the classical approach developed by Rose, Ferrante, Smith and collaborators is performed. It is concluded that the correlation involving CED and B 0  is a manifestation of a significant degree of “universality” in the variation of the cohesive properties with the Wigner–Seitz radius of these compounds.},

Some properties (entropy, temperature, specific heat) of the nanocrystal are calculated numerically but exactly within the framework of the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the presence of a surface in the nanocrystal modifies the thermostatistic properties to a greater extent than the small number of atoms in the system. The specific heat Cv behaves similarly to the Einstein solid, with an asymptotic value for high temperatures that differs from that of the Dulong-Petit law by a term of the order of NA\textasciicircum (-1/3) and that can be explained easily in terms of the surface. The entropy is non-additive, but this is due to the presence of the surface and we show that the additivity is recovered in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we find that, when calculations follow the canonical ensemble, results differ little for small systems (NA = 27) and are inexistent for larger systems (NA = 1000).},

Using this model, and “universal” values for the function and its first and second derivatives at the equilibrium distance (z=0), three general interrelations between EOS parameters and the cohesive energy are obtained. The first correlation involves the bulk modulus, and the second, the thermal expansion coefficient. In order to test these results an extensive database is developed, which involves available experimental data, and results of current ab initio density-functional-theory calculations using the VASP code. In particular, the 0~K values for volume, bulk modulus, its pressure derivative, and the cohesive energy of 27 elements belonging to the first (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), second (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd) and third (Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au) transition row of the Periodic Table are calculated ab initio and used to test the present results. The third correlation obtained, allows an evaluation of the third derivative of F(z) at z=0 for the current elements. With this new information, a discussion is presented of the possibility of finding a “universal” F(z) versus z function able to account accurately for the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus of the transition elements.},

The samples studied are polycrystalline columnar grains of 11–38\,nm average diameter, and different textures. The focus is on deformation mechanisms in the crack tip region and the influence of texture, grain size and temperature on the fracture propagation. We found that the [1–100] texture is the most brittle with deformation at the crack tip occurring only through twinning with almost no dislocation activity. The more ductile textures are those where dislocation mechanisms are activated. For the basal orientation we observed {$<$}a{$>$} dislocations while {$<$}c\,+\,a{$>$} dislocations are dominant for the [11–20] texture. One important observation is that crack propagation can be hindered by the presence of the grain boundaries. As a result, samples with the smallest grain sizes are the more resistant to crack propagation. As expected, higher temperatures imply easier deformation, resulting in more ductile behavior for all orientations. At room temperature and higher, crack propagation occurs mostly intra granularly. However, at 77\,K the [1–100] textured sample shows crack propagation through the nucleation of micro-voids ahead of the main crack.},

The analysis was performed on well-oriented CuZnAl single crystalline shape-memory alloys subjected to uniaxial tensile loadings, combining direct strain measurements determined with an extensometer and the four-lead electrical resistance technique. In that way the relationship between strain and electrical resistance could be evaluated by formulating a physics based model that can be easily contrasted with the experimental characterization of a simple benchmark system. It was found that the model here developed provides general guidelines for the selection of a shape-memory material for positioning actuators and that the correlation between strain and electrical resistance is of rather limited precision, even for the simplest material case and loading condition analyzed. The effects of temperature, deformation rate, temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of austenite and martensite phases and temperature dependence of the strain associated with the stress induced transformation were carefully characterized. Results suggest that the direct use of feedback from electrical resistance measurements for precise positioning is arguable unless materials with low hysteresis and low latent heat of transformation are used in combination with quasi-static operating conditions.},

Related issues are addressed in this report with emphasis on insulating materials. Also, strategies for estimating vibrational entropies and melting points from FP calculations or chemical systematics are discussed. Some strategies for including SRO (beyond pair correlations) in CALPHAD calculations are discussed in the last section. Sections II and V are concerned with using FP electronic structure calculations to obtain composition dependent thermodynamic functions and physical properties.

  abstract = {Here we explore the synthesis of alkanethiol-coated Ni NPs following the one-phase reaction method by Brust et al.(1) The reduction of NiCl2 with NaBH4 in the presence of dodecanethiol (C12SH) yields a complex product that is difficult to identify as illustrated in the figure of merit. We synthesized Ni(II) dodecanethiolate (C12S) (without the addition of NaBH4) for comparison and performed an exhaustive characterization with TEM, HR-TEM, AFM, MFM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis, magnetism, and FT-IR. It is found that the organic coating is not quite a well-organized self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surrounding the Ni cluster as previously reported.(2, 3) XPS and XRD data show slight differences between both syntheses; however, Ni(II) thiolate appears to be more stable than reduced Ni when exposed to ambient air, indicating the propensity of metallic Ni to oxidize. It has been shown that irradiating with TEM electrons over various metal thiolates leads to nanoparticle formation.(4) We irradiated over Ni(II) thiolate and observed no evidence of NP formation whereas irradiating a reduced Ni sample exhibited an ∼3.0 nm nanoparticle diameter. Magnetism studies showed a difference between both samples, indicating ferromagnetic character for the reduced Ni sample. According to our results, the product of the synthesis is comprised of ultrasmall metallic clusters embedded in some form of Ni(II) C 12S. In this work, we open a discussion of the chemical nature of the core and the shell in the synthesis of Ni NPs protected with organomercaptan molecules. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We report a modification of the metal-complex decomposition in organic media method in which we replace iron(iii) acetylacetonate (Fe(Acac)3) with an iron–urea complex (Fe-Urea) as metal source for the synthesis. With this modification we were able to obtain small particle sizes with a good control in size distribution. The Fe-Urea complex is easy to prepare with excellent yields. Core–shell nanoparticles are then prepared using palladium(ii) acetylacetonate as a Pd source, to obtain a Pd0 shell stabilised by oleylamine. The core–shell superparamagnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4@Pd-OA are extensively characterized by FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis, thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry, and magnetic susceptibility measurements, and tested in a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling Suzuki–Miyaura reaction with promising results.}

The supports were obtained through two different synthesis methods: co-precipitation (PI) and mechanochemical reaction (MR). Characterization of the catalysts, before and after ESR, were performed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), nitrogen physisorption, CO chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), thermogravimetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The Ru (2wt.\%) PI catalyst exhibited the highest activity and selectivity to hydrogen and no coke deposition was observed during catalytic operation, even when compared to Ni (8wt.\%) PI catalyst. A possible reaction pathway is proposed. The remarkably good catalytic performance of Ru (2wt.\%) PI is regarded as being due to a combination of factors: improved metal dispersion on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, favorable metal-support interaction and water gas shift reaction promotion.},

This method consists of ball milling of LiCl, TiO2 and NaOH in air atmosphere at room temperature and posterior calcination. Structural, microstructural and textural characteristics of the Li2TiO3 powders as well as of the pellets before and after annealing were determined. Remarkable contraction of the material and high mechanical stability was observed after treatment at 800 °C for 5 h. Finally, the behaviour in reductive and inert atmospheres of the sintered and green pellets was studied, characterizing the extension and impact of the reactions on the physicochemical and structural stability of the material. It can be concluded that the sintered pellets became mechanically stable due to the thermal treatment, showing no physicochemical modifications after analysis in different atmospheres up to 800 °C.},

The internal friction and dynamic shear modulus spectra as a function of temperature show variations which are strongly dependent on the dose. The 480 K internal friction peak of the unirradiated alloy (attributed in a previous work to solute dragging by dislocations) shifts to higher temperatures after irradiation. This peak shift is interpreted in terms of dislocation pinning by irradiation-induced clusters. The shear modulus increases by 15\% at low doses and remains stable during thermal cycling in the range 300-550 K. It is shown that this hardening cannot be explained solely by dislocation pinning; an additional direct bulk effect of interstitials and clusters created by thermal neutrons is proposed to account for it. Complete recovery in the shear modulus is observed for higher doses after thermal cycling.},

It is also found in solubilized, quenched and overaged samples. The internal friction maximum is attributed to a mechanism in which: a) lattice dislocations are firmly pinned by β″ or β′ precipitates and b) lattice dislocation motion is controlled by the dragging of a complex Cottrell cloud composed by Mg and Si solute atoms. A good description of the experimental results is provided considering that the dislocation motion is controlled by transverse diffusion of Mg-Si pairs in the dislocation core. Relaxation mechanisms related with grain boundaries or precipitates can be discarded.},

The aim of this work is to check the influence of certain fabrication parameters (the alloy chemical composition, the extrusion temperature and the homogenization conditions) on the grain boundary internal friction peaks of a special set of alloys. The relaxation strength increases with increasing Si content. This effect is due to an enhancement of Si grain boundary precipitation. We do not observe the dependence on the excess Si (with respect to the stoichiometric chemical composition) predicted by others authors. The extrusion temperature indicates a separation of the alloys into different groups obeying different β and Si grain boundary precipitation. The homogenization parameters do not seem to be important in this case.},

Thus, this work introduces an innovative method for assessing stress–strain properties at a sub-millimeter scale and illustrates the potential of the technique by evaluating the strength of a sub- region in the HAZ from welded steels pipes. The method employs a fully instrumented stage inside a scanning electron microscope that stretches small tensile specimens (2.0 mm · 0.5 mm cross-section, 12.5 mm gage length) while registering detailed images of the deformed region. The specimens, cut from full-scale welds, include in their gage length weld metal, base metal and HAZ and have an 85 lm period grid of evaporated lead on their surface to visualise the deformation. Upon straining, local strain is determined by correlating sequential images of the specimen surface with an open source code for particle image velocimetry. The calculated local strain within the HAZ and the load values recorded during testing are converted into a local stress–strain response. The results for two different heat inputs agree with usual, but indirect and less accurate assessments procedures, including local hardness measurements and notched bar testing. KEY},

  abstract = {The structural assessment of welded joints requires that the weld metal and the heataffected zone (HAZ) have adequate fracture toughness values. The measurement of these quantities is still controversial due to the inhomogeneous properties of the welds, which affects standardized methodologies. This work presents local measurements of the fracture toughness of the heat-affected zones from welded steel pipes. Fracture tests were performed inside the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using small specimens, allowing the direct measurement of the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) on the surface. CTODs of approximately half a millimeter were attained for crack growth of about onetenth of a millimeter before the crack crossed the fusion line. Three methods for computing the CTOD were compared, and the differences among the results were discussed. Furthermore, the surface strain field, calculated by measuring the distortion of a regular grid, showed evidence of an influence of HAZ inhomogeneity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results were compared to those obtained in a similar alloy with no Mg content. The hardness evolution in the Mg containing alloy was similar to that of the Mg free alloy, but shifted by about 50 Hv to higher values for all ageing times. The peak hardness occurred after 3 h ageing in both alloys, with a value slightly above 200 Hv in the Mg containing alloy. The microstructure of the peak aged and the overaged condition were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the Mg-containing alloy the microstructure of the peak aged condition consisted of plate-shaped precipitates, with a very similar structure to that of the θ′ phase and a high density of small needle-shaped precipitates lying along the {$<$} 100 {$>$} Al directions. In the peak aged and overaged conditions the needle-shaped precipitates were found to belong to the Q′ phase (Al4Cu2Mg8Si7) or its precursor phases, previously observed in the Al–Mg–Si system with minor Cu additions.},

This paper outlines the development of a simple physicochemical model to simulate the impedance response of the Ni-MH battery system. The model describes the individual electrodes as porous flooded structures where the electrochemical processes take place at the active material/electrolyte interface. The physicochemical system parameters are grouped in such a way that the derived simple model can be experimentally identifiable. Experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, recorded with a laboratory built prototype, are used to identify the model parameters by fitting the theoretical impedance function derived from the model. An analysis of the predicted dependence of the impedance function with the battery SOC and the identifiability of different system parameters are presented. © 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

The fracture process was followed by simultaneous observation of the sample and recording the loading variables. The instability fracture toughness was strongly dependent on the fibre-reinforced epoxy layer and the crack-growth in the external aluminum layers, prior to fracture instability, was influenced by the notch acuity. The load versus load-line displacement behaviour and load instabilities were similar to the ones obtained by conventional testing procedures. The technique implemented proved to be a powerful tool to study the fracture micromechanisms of aramid-aluminum laminates or other fibre-metal laminates and to correlate them with the recorded macro events.},

  abstract = {With the intention of determining the local thickness within a crystalline thin foil specimen, by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a method previously proposed by Zuo and Shi [J.M. Zuo, Y.F. Shi, Microsc. Microanal. 7 (Suppl. 2) (2001) 224-225] was applied. Using the convergent beam technique, with the incident beam parallel to a zone axis with low indices, diffraction patterns were obtained for some aluminum alloys with low solute content. These patterns were contrasted with those obtained from simulations based on the dynamic theory with Bloch's waves formalism. The local thickness of the thin foil was then obtained by visually comparing the simulated patterns with the experimental one. Comparison of the proposed method with that based on the analysis of two-beam convergent beam patterns [P.M. Kelly, A. Jostsons, R.G. Blake, J.G. Napier, Phys. Stat. Solidi (a) 31 (1975) 771-780] and with that based on the ratio of intensity of the zero loss peak to the total intensity in an electron energy loss spectrum [R.F. Egerton, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy in the Electron Microscope, second ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1996] was carried out. A very good agreement between thicknesses determined using the different methods was found. The sensitivity of the method of Zuo et al. was found to be about 1 or 2 nm. The advantages and limitations of the different methods are discussed. The method of Zuo et al. can provide fast and reliable results and can be applied in all modern instruments. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results obtained indicate that the hardness response is faster and the peak hardness is higher when plastic deformation and micro-alloying are applied together than performing each procedure individually. Different amounts of deformation, ranging from 0\% to 30\% have been utilized. An optimum deformation degree for the hardening response has been established around 8\% for the Al-Cu-Si-Ge alloy. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the peak hardness is due to a complex microstructure that contained  disc shaped precipitates, rod-shaped Si-Ge precipitates and  plates that were heterogeneously nucleated on the Si-Ge particles. Pre-deformation has been found to stimulate the growth of the  plates due to enhanced diffusion along dislocation cores. Increasing deformation reduces the influence of the Si-Ge precipitates on heterogeneous nucleation, leading to reduced peak hardness and faster over-ageing.},

Several glycine-to-nitrates molar ratios were investigated. A detailed morphological and structural characterization was performed, employing X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, and electron microscopy (scanning and transmission). The as-synthesized LSCM nanopowders consist of interconnected nanoparticles forming a sponge-like structure with typical meso- and macropores. For glycineto- nitrates molar ratios above stoichiometric molar ratio, a high proportion of well-crystallized LSCM phase was obtained. An increase of glycine content in the initial synthesis gel, decreases the average nanoparticles size from ̃20 to ̃6 nm, narrows the distribution crystallite size, and increases the specific surface area of the LSCM nanopowders from ̃14 to ̃30 m 2/g.

  abstract = {The two way shape memory effect (TWME) can be obtained in single crystals of Cu–Zn–Al, Cu–Al–Ni and Cu–Al–Be alloys simply by a diffusion controlled stabilization of the martensite phase. After the retransformation to the austenite on heating some nuclei are retained which are responsible for the formation of preferential martensite variants on cooling without a stress. In this paper it is attempted to contribute to the clarification of the nature of these nuclei in Cu–Zn–Al single crystals. In the single crystals with martensite start temperatures between 0 and 20°C the martensite was stress induced and aged at 60°C. Samples which were retransformed on heating were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Thin martensite plates were observed to remain even after the bulk had retransformed owing to a diffusion controlled lowering of their free energy and probably to pinning effects. They acted as nuclei which on cooling first expanded laterally and then thickened, their high density leading to a perfect TWME.},

The influence of the degree of long-range order on the transformation has been determined by using different heat treatments. The transformation temperatures are strongly influenced by the degree of order in the austenite: annealing from above or below the second neighbor L2(1) ordering temperature changes the M-s by more than 100 degrees C. It has been established that the diffusion in the austenite as well as in the martensite phase is considerably slower in this alloy than in other Cu-based ones, due to the presence of Ni. The obtained TWME has a similar efficiency as when other more complex thermomechanical trainings are made. In this alloy, the TWME by stabilization is not complete, in contrast to that in Cu-Zn-Al single crystals},

The influence of the dislocations manifests itself in the formation of thin martensite plates above the bulk MS in order to reduce the stress fields, and in the selection of preferentially one group of self accommodating variants with only a small TWME. A perfect TWME can be obtained after stabilization of a single stress induced variant. This is due to the retention of small martensite nuclei which are stable to quite high temperatures, which can grow on cooling without the need to be nucleated first, and which can impede the growth of other inclined variants. The present results are compared with fatigue cycling experiments in single crystals and the TWME in trained polycrystals.},

However, in these experimental images an extra intensity modulation is frequently observed as is the case for hexagonal polytypes and 18R‐type structures; this is intuitively not expected on the basis of the structure for perfectly oriented crystals. Moreover, the kinematically forbidden reflections are much stronger than predicted by computer simulations assuming perfect orientation of the crystal.

The PVD process used a low operative pressure, reducing the bombardment damage on the substrate, in comparison with other methods. Internal friction (IF) and elastic modulus measurements were carried out in TiN-PVD coated AISI 304 stainless steel, using a sub-resonant torsion pendulum (f ≅ 1 Hz) and a vibrant-reed instrument (f ≅ 103Hz). Some experiments showed several internal friction peaks, which are attributed to dislocation relaxation and to martensitic transformation from γ to α′. The characterization was carried out with X-ray, AFM and SEM. Analysis of X-ray peaks indicates a residual deformation in the order of 0.0005-0.0009 for γ-phase and 0.0006-0.00204 for α′-phase. Two methods are presented to determine the adhesion energy by IF in coated materials: for the first the enthalpy is determined by means of isochronal IF measurements, while for the second it is determined using isothermal measurements. These produce an image of damage caused by the bombardment on the substrate, especially of the residual defects. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The observed microstructure of the ribbons consisted of a B2 austenite phase with very small grains, 50 nm-2 μm in diameter, a large density of dislocations and Ni4Ti3precipitates. After cycling, the only observed differences are a slight increase in the dislocation density and regions with the R-phase. This suggests that the decrease in the transformation stress could be attributed to the nucleation process of the particular dislocations necessary to accommodate the martensite in the present configuration of grains and precipitates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper establishes the chemical nature of Pd nanoparticles protected by alkanethiolates that were prepared through a ligand place-exchange approach and the two-phase method, first developed for Au nanoparticles by Brust and Schiffrin. After 10 years since the first study on this kind of Pd nanoparticles was published, the surface composition of the particles is a matter of debate in the literature and it has not been unambiguously assessed. The nanoparticles were studied by means of several techniques: UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimental data, obtained for the 3 nm diameter Pd particles, prepared by both synthetic routes, are consistent with nanoparticles composed by Pd(0) cores surrounded by a submonolayer of sulfide species, which are protected by alkanethiolates. Also, we unambiguously demonstrate that the chemical nature of these particles is very similar to that experimentally found for alkanethiolate-modified bulk Pd. The results from this paper are important not only for handling thiolate-protected Pd nanoparticles in catalysis and sensing, but also for the basic comprehension of metallic nanoparticles and the relation of their surface structure with the synthesis method. -� 2012 American Chemical Society},

We used the A s and M s temperatures as input information in an analysis based on thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energy of the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases. In these models, the magnetic contribution to Gibbs energy is accounted for, which allows us to study, by calculation, the influence of the entropy of magnetic ordering upon the relative stability of the phases. The picture of magnetic effects upon the fcc/hcp transformation that emerges from our work is as follows. At low Mn contents, the martensitic transformation temperatures are larger than the Néel temperature of the fcc phase, and both A s and M s decrease linearly with increasing Mn. This encourages an extrapolation to zero Mn content, and we use that to critically discuss the available information on the fcc/hcp equilibrium temperature for Fe at atmospheric pressure. At sufficiently large Mn contents, we have M s},

A, 1995, vol. 26A, p. 1957â69), presents a study of the energetics of the heterogeneous nucleation of hcp martensite in the fcc matrix of the Fe-Mn system. A major goal of the work is the exploration of the various qualitative and quantitative consequences of applying the Olson and Cohen approach (OCA) to the most reliable information on the Fe-Mn system. To this end, an extensive assessment of the quantities involved in the OCA is performed. The selected Gibbs energy and the lattice parameter descriptions for fcc and hcp are based on recent experimental studies. Explicit calculations are presented of the key quantities in the OCA, including those quantities that have not yet been measured. In particular, a probable range of values is established for the surface energy parameter Ï, which plays a crucial role in the treatment of the nucleation size. On these bases, values are derived for the probable number of atomic planes (n C) of the embryo, which, according to the OCA, is at the condition of spontaneous growth. Predictions of the Mn content upon n C are also reported. The present attempt to calculate in detail the energetics of the fcc âhcp martensitic transformation also revealed the lack of thermophysical data for Fe-Mn alloys. The need for experimental studies of various relevant quantities is emphasized.},

In part I, an experimental database was built up using dilatometric measurements, which covers the composition range in which the fcc↔hcp MT is detected. This new information is analysed in the present work using models for the molar Gibbs energy (Gm) of the various phases. Hcp is a metastable phase in the system, but we show that its properties can be inferred from selected pieces of experimental data, using the concept of T0 temperature. The assessed Gm functions of the ternary fcc and hcp phases are used to evaluate the so-called resistance-to-start-the-transformation energy (RSTE). According to our results the RSTE in this system vary smoothly with composition, and we account phenomenologically for that using low-order polynomials in the atomic fractions. Finally, the optimum Gm and RSTE functions are also used to calculate the MS and AS temperatures for arbitrary compositions in the ternary system. The extensive comparisons between calculations and measurements presented in this work show a very good agreement, which adds to the credibility of the present approach.},

We generated nanoparticles of different shapes (sphere, icosahedron, octahedron, cuboctahedron) and compared the resulting P-C isotherms with the bulk and a few available experimental results. Instead of the plateau corresponding to the α-β PdH equilibrium in the bulk, the nanoparticles isotherms show at least a two-plateaux behavior, corresponding to a subsurface hydride formation and a subsequent filling of the core of the nano-particle with H atoms.

As a main result, we show that the distribution of inter-granular distances has a unique behavior for tubular structures of similar diameter/length aspect ratio, independent of their sizes. This scaling relation allows us to perform the simulations using a tube of smaller dimensions.

  abstract = {The influence of natural aging on precipitation hardening of an Al-Mg-Si alloy was investigated by mechanical testing and quantitative transmission electron microscopy. It was found that natural aging increases yield stress and reduces ductility, which is attributed to the formation of Mg/Si clusters. The evolution of tensile properties saturates after around 7 days natural aging. Artificial aging for 30. min at 180°C after solution treatment resulted in an important increase in yield strength and loss of ductility, due to the rapid precipitation of the β'' intermediate phase. Previous natural aging progressively reduces the strengthening effect of 30. min/180°C artificial aging, completely suppressing it after 7 days pre-aging. Microhardness evolution during 180°C artificial aging was followed in samples that were aged immediately after quenching, and with 7 days natural aging before artificial aging. In addition, microstructural characterization using TEM was carried out at specific artificial aging times. Previous natural aging was found to reduce the initial hardening rate, producing a delay in the formation of β'' precipitates. The peak-aging condition was reached almost at the same aging time. However, longer β'' precipitates with a lower volume fraction were observed when artificial aging was preceded by natural aging. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The dislocations move on the basal plane and have the shortest possible translation Burgers vector. The critical resolved shear stress increases with temperature above room temperature and the strain rate sensitivity decreases, reaching negative values at elevated temperatures. The results cannot be explained by an increased friction stress of the moving dislocations due to diffusion induced reordering of the antiphase boundary between the partials. It is instead suggested that diffusion modifies the dislocation configuration, essentially after it gets immobilized at obstacles.},

The requirements of the design were to characterize the new variables appearing in a commercially assembled battery, such as limited physical space, electrical contact resistance, the behaviour of the system as a function of the gas evolution during fast charge and overcharge, and others. The electrochemical characterization was performed using laboratory equipment. In the first design version an anode and a cathode, both embedded in electrolyte, and electrically isolated by means of a separator, were placed inside a reactor. Based on the identification of problems detected in the structural performance analysis and the electrochemical characterization of the different prototype models, the versatility and usefulness of the designs were optimized. The final prototype design was satisfactorily tested in electrochemical cycling and rate capability studies, with different electrode and separator materials and using different weights between electrodes. The internal pressure monitoring of a sealed cell, under different conditions of use, was also demonstrated, thus proving that the design allows the systematic study of different application requirements. © 2009 Professor T.

The hydrogen storage alloy (MH) is an AB5-type (Lm0.95Ni3.8Co0.3Mn0.3Al0.4), where Lm is a mixture of rare earths, and it was prepared by melting the constituent elements in an electric induction furnace. The CNE were synthesized by two-stage polymerization of furfuryl alcohol, drying and carbonization, and were subsequently doped with different proportions of Ni (0-20\%) by the method of wet impregnation with Nickel nitrate hexahydrate. The behavior of electrochemical cells consisting of a working electrode with 45\% of MH, 5\% of CNE pure and doped with different proportions of Ni and 50\% carbon Teflon acting as electrical and mechanical support, a counter electrode of Ni mesh, and a reference electrode Hg/HgO was studied. The experiments covered electrochemical activation and cycle stability, rate capability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the addition of CNE improves the electrochemical performance, and particularly the CNEs pure and doped with 20\% of Ni present the best electrochemical performance in discharge capacity, rate capability and impedance spectroscopy. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The device was studied under a wide range of charge current (0.1-5 C), establishing that optimum conditions to minimize the inner pressure during uninterrupted use are obtained if either charge rates up to 0.5 C or higher rates not surpassing 90\% of the nominal capacity are employed. Charge times corresponding to the range between 80\% and 130\% of the nominal capacity were also tested, analyzing the effect of overcharges on inner pressure, discharge capacity, efficiency and integrity of the cell. It was verified that charging the cell up to 130\% at 2 C rate reaches an inner pressure 5 times higher than that obtained at 0.5 C. High rate discharge was also characterized at uninterrupted use of the cell, demonstrating the importance of the cut-off discharge criterion at high rates, to avoid the inner gases accumulation due to incomplete discharge of electrodes and overcharge in a following electrochemical cycle. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cu-Zn-Al shape-memory alloy single crystals can have two sequential, stress-induced martensitic transitions, depending on their chemical composition and crystallographic orientation: first, the β-18R transition and, as the load increases, the 18R-6R transition. At electronic concentration e/a=1.48, the 18R-6R transition is immediately followed by the plastic deformation of the 6R phase. This phenomenon is usually undesired, as it compromises the reversibility of the pseudoelastic effect. Two different approaches have been applied to counteract the plastic deformation of the 6R phase: 1. A modification of the chemical composition of the alloy, reducing e/a; 2. The controlled introduction of gamma-phase precipitates, which increases the yield stress of the 6R phase. The former approach was relatively successful but, al lower e/a, the kinetics of defect formation and propagation due to pseudoelastic cycling are significantly increased, which renders these alloys unsuitable for most applications. The latter approach, on the other hand, results in 6R without plastic deformation, and does not seem to have a negative impact in the fatigue life of the alloy. However, the authors only studied one specific distribution of precipitates which, despite being successful, may not be the optimal condition to harden the 6R phase and increase pseudoelastic fatigue life. No information is available in the literature regarding the effect of different precipitate sizes on the 18R-6R transformation.},

  abstract = {Mechanical damping applications could benefit from the large hysteresis, large pseudoelastic strain and the fact that the transformation stresses of the 18R↔6R martensite-martensite transformation depend very little on temperature in Cu-based alloys. This work presents the 18R↔6R mechanical cycling behavior of CuZnAl shape-memory alloy single crystals with electronic concentration e/a=1.48. A fine distribution of gamma phase nanoprecipitates is introduced to prevent plastic deformation of the 6R phase. Results show that, although significant 6R stabilization is observed at very low frequencies (below 10-2Hz), it is possible to obtain more than 1000 stable pseudoelastic cycles with only minor changes in transformation stresses and hysteresis width at frequencies above 10-1Hz. A more pronounced decrease in transformation stresses is observed after 1000 cycles. Nevertheless, the decrease in hysteresis is small up to 2000 cycles. Reported and present results indicate that pair interchange of atoms can explain the stabilization of 6R under quasistatic experimental conditions. However, at higher frequencies of cycling, stabilization of this martensite shows additional features, leading to a dynamic stabilization with slight effects on the mechanical behavior at the required frequency and number of cycles. On the whole, the behavior of this transformation is unique and very promising. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The stress induced martensitic transformations between different metastable phases in Cu-Al-Be shape-memory alloy single crystals were assessed experimentally. In particular, the successive stress induced transformations from the high temperature austenitic DO3 structure (β1) to the 18R and to the 6R martensites were considered. Several distinct features which characterize the stress induced transformations in Cu-Al-Be and distinguish this system from other Cu-based shape-memory alloys are reported in this work. It was found that the 6R phase forms from a distorted 18R and that this stress induced transformation is highly reversible with no plastic deformation accompanying the process. The stress induced transformation from the distorted 18R to the 6R structure exhibits wide hysteresis, comparable with values observed in the NiTi system. A slightly negative temperature dependence of the critical stress to induce the 6R martensite was determined. Finally, a stress-temperature phase transformation diagram involving the metastable β1, 18R and 6R phases is proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This work has its roots in a long-term theoretical research line aimed at developing a complete database with structural, thermodynamic, cohesive and elastic properties of the intermetallic compounds (ICs) of the type MeaXbwhere Me~=~Cu, Ni and X~=~In, Sn and Sb. The paper reports the results of an ab initio study of various phases occurring in the Ni-Sb phase diagram, viz., the low-temperature Ni3Sb (orthorhombic oP8), the high-temperature Ni3Sb (cubic cF16), Ni5Sb2(monoclinic mC28), NiSb (hexagonal hP4) and the NiSb2(orthorhombic oP6) compounds. The molar volume, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative, the electronic density of states (DOS) and the energy of formation from the elements of these compounds are calculated ab initio using the relativistic projected augmented wave (PAW) method implemented in the VASP code. The Local Density Approximation of Ceperley and Alder and the Generalized Gradient Approximation due to Perdew and Wang are adopted to treat the exchange and correlation energies. Detailed comparisons between the current and previously reported theoretical and experimental values are reported.},

Here, we report the microstructure of electrodeposition grown Fe-Pd nanowires in which the process was confined to polycarbonate membranes with a nominal pore diameter of 200 nm. We used an acid electrolyte (pH ≈ 5) in which the solution was stabilized with sulfosalicylic acid. The average chemical concentration of the nanowires can be systematically shifted from rich palladium to rich iron by changing the growth potential. The study of the microstructure by transmission electron microscopy indicates high chemical inhomogeneities due to phase coexistence between rich palladium regions (with FCC structure) and rich iron regions. The latter present a combination of BCC and amorphous phases. The average chemical composition of the nanowires can be better adjusted by using a low frequency square wave voltage excitation (alternating rich Pd and rich Fe regions). However, independently of the growth process, the nanowires morphology collapses after thermal annealing. This could be ascribed to fragile grain boundaries due to the presence of amorphous hydroxides and chemical impurities produced during the electrochemical process.},

Under small-scale yielding conditions, the mixed-mode crack growth rates were found to correlate best with √ΔK eff2 II +1.2 ΔK eff2 III in maraging steel, while for Ti-6Al-4V, √ΔK eff2 II +1.2 ΔK eff2 III appeared suitable. For extended plasticity, a crack growth prediction method is proposed and validated for Ti-6Al-4V.

  abstract = {Cyclic loading is one of the generic characteristic features of many of the present and potential future applications of NiTi shape memory alloys, no matter whether they exploit mechanical (pseudo-elasticity) or thermal shape memory (one and two way effect). Cyclic loading may well be associated with structural and functional fatigue, which both limit the service life of shape memory components. By "structural fatigue" we mean the microstructural damage that accumulates during cyclic loading and eventually leads to fatigue failure. There is a need to understand how microstructures can be optimized to provide good fatigue resistance. The term "functional fatigue" indicates that shape memory effects like the working displacement in a one way effect (1WE) actuator or the dissipated energy in a loading-unloading cycle of a pseudo-elastic (PE) damping application decrease with increasing cycle numbers. This is also due to a gradual change in microstructure. In both cases it is important to know how fatigue cycling affects shape memory properties. The present paper considers structural and functional fatigue of NiTi shape memory alloys. It discusses four cases of fatigue in NiTi shape memory alloys: (1) The evolution of the stress-strain hysteresis in low cycle pull-pull fatigue of pseudo-elastic NiTi wires. (2) Bending-rotation fatigue rupture of pseudo-elastic NiTi wires. (3) Strain localization during the stress induced formation of martensite. (4) Generic features of functional fatigue in NiTi shape memory actuator springs. The paper shows that fatigue of shape memory alloys is a fascinating research field and highlights the need for further work in this area. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Cu L2,3 white-lines intensities, which reflect the unoccupied density of states in 3d bands, were measured in situ, during the phase transformation in both the martensite and austenite phases. We find that the white-lines intensity decreases during the inverse transformation, when going from martensite to austenite. Even though the initial 3d occupation numbers in 2H and 18R martensitic structures are different, after the transformation, the 3d occupation numbers in the now austenitic structure have decreased in both samples, indicating that some electrons left Cu 3d bands during phase transformation. Interestingly enough, the occupation numbers in the final phases, which have the same structure, reach the same value, indicating that changes in EELS spectra are a consequence of structural changes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The structure and texture formation in Cu-Al-Ni thin films of different thicknesses (1 μm to 5 μm) grown by DC magnetron sputtering without any intentional heating of the substrate are reported. The as-grown films present grains with an average size of 20 nm. The films with thickness of 1 μm have a single metastable phase with a hexagonal structure and are textured with planes (0002) parallel to the plane of the films. It was observed that thicker films present phase coexistence between metastable hexagonal and body centered cubic structures with a gradual increment of the body centered cubic phase fraction. The films with thickness of 5 μm are textured with planes (0002) and 101̄0 in the hexagonal structure, whereas in the body centered cubic structure the films are textured with \{110\} planes parallel to the plane of the films. This fact can be associated with self-heating of the substrate during the growth of the films and with the relative stability of the metastable phases. Free standing films annealed in a second step (1123 K for 1 h) present austenitic phase with L2 structure and sub-micrometric grains textured with \{220\} planes parallel to the plane of the films.

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

A fitting formula for the present energy loss values is provided. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

There is a conflict between the results of these approaches and the purpose was now to investigate whether the causes of the conflict can be clarified by applying thermodynamic methods, and considering various types of available information, melting points, entropy differences, phase diagrams, and the models for solution behaviour used in current CALPHAD work. It is concluded that the reconciliation of these approaches to phase stability of the transition metals cannot be achieved unless a) CALPHAD assumption of a positive melting temperature for all metastable phases is abandoned, and b) the assumption of small deviations from the regular-solution behaviour, which is implicit in the current CALPHAD models for the solution phases, is replaced by treatments accounting for the existence of sharper variations in the thermodynamic properties with the delectron concentration.},

The solid solutions of carbon in the h.c.p. and b.c.c. phases of Zr and the non-stoichiometric NaCl-type structure ZrCx carbide are treated by using the compound energy model (CEM) for interstitial phases. The liquid phase is treated by using a substitutional solution model and the Redlich-Kister formalism for excess Gibbs energies. The parameters in the models are determined by computerized optimization of selected experimental data. The metastable carbides ZrC0.5 and ZrC3, that are involved in the CEM for the interstitial solutions of C in h.c.p. and b.c.c. Zr respectively, are described using estimated values for the entropy and enthalpy of formation. These estimates are based on the regular behaviour of the vibrational entropy and other cohesive properties which have been established in recent studies on transition metal compounds. A thermodynamic description is obtained which is used to construct, by calculation, the ZrC phase diagram. Detailed comparisons are presented between calculations and experimental data of various kinds.

Many of the carbides considered here are metastable and their cohesive energy is not known from direct measurements. In these cases, we estimate E(coh) using thermodynamic model calculations and analyses of phase diagrams. This information allows us to perform a detailed comparison of theoretical (E(coh)th) and thermodynamic (E(coh)e) cohesive energy values. The difference E(coh)th - E(coh)e is positive for all carbides and nitrides, and we discuss the various sources of error in the theoretical approach. Trends in theoretical E(coh) values are remarkably improved when spectroscopic data are used to correct calculated atomic total energies. We also show that most of the discrepancy between theoretical and thermodynamic results cancels in the difference DELTA-E(coh) between a carbide MC and a nitride MN of the same transition-metal M, and excellent agreement with experiments is obtained for the systems where thermodynamic information is available, viz., for M = Zr, Nb, and Mo. This fact allows us to estimate the unknown cohesive energies and enthalpies of formation for YN, TcN and for the metastable NaCl structures of RuN, RhN, and PdN, from a combination of ab initio results and assessed thermodynamic information for the corresponding carbides. Our method of theory-based predictions of thermodynamic quantities is compared with the semiempirical method of Miedema. We also discuss the role of extrapolation methods related to ab initio results in the estimation of thermodynamic information that is used in the modeling of alloy phase diagrams.},

The ab initio calculations show that fcc W is dynamically unstable for all long-wavelength shear modes at T=0 K. Even if fcc W becomes dynamically stable at high temperatures, the enthalpy of fcc W derived from Calphad analyses cannot be compared with the ab initio enthalpy of fcc W without a detailed knowledge of the vibrational entropy.

  abstract = {Thermodynamic data provide a kind of information on the cohesive properties of materials which is appropriate for the analysis of regularities and trends across the periodic table. This approach has been applied to the study of bonding trends in solid and liquid MeN nitride phases with Me being Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co or Ni. The bonding strength is characterized by using a quantity introduced by us which measures the energy gained when forming the substance from the elements. This quantity, called the bonding enthalpy, is evaluated for both stable and metastable solid MeN phases with the (cF8) NaCl-type structure. Stable phases are treated by relying on calorimetric data, while the properties of metastable phases are obtained from calculations based on the compound energy model (CEM) for interstitial solutions. This analysis is complemented with a study of the bonding enthalpy of MeN liquid nitrides, which are considered in a special ordered state that is comparable with the (cF8) structure. Information about these liquid phases is obtained from the interaction energies that are involved in the nearest-neighbour bond energy model (NN-BEM) for condensed mixtures. A complete account is given of the use of the CEM and NN-BEM in a thermochemical characterization of bonding strengths. The bonding enthalpies arrived at in this work are used in establishing trends across the 3d transition series which are considered in the light of recent studies of the electronic structure of NaCl-type structure carbides and nitrides. In addition, a detailed comparison is performed with the approach to cohesion in alloys developed by Miedema and coworkers. Our analysis reveals significant systematic discrepancies. Finally, the information obtained by us is applied in examining theoretical and empirical generalizations about the predominance of chemical bonding effects in the heat of formation of compounds.},

  abstract = {Carbon supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) have been prepared through polyols method using PVP. As observed with a large number of surfactants employed in NPs synthesis, it is very difficult to attain an efficient NPs cleaning, which is a fundamental requirement in catalysis researches. The aim of this paper was to obtain clean NPs, beginning by using "soft" methods, in order to keep unaltered both the NPs size and shape; however, an important surfactant remnant was observed. Consequently, it was performed an electrochemical cleaning through PVP and glycolate electro-oxidation, being accompanied with important perturbations of NPs atoms and dissolution and re-deposition of Pt. Finally, the performance of the catalyst towards the glycerol electro-oxidation reaction (GER), before and after the cleaning process was studied. In addition, we demonstrate how the impurities bring about poor reproducibility in this kind of experiments due to the fact that the cleaning process is occurring at the same time that the GER and because cleaning extent along cycles varies for each independent experiment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract The different microstructures typically found in nuclear components made of zirconium alloys are discussed in this paper. These include material in a variety of thermo-mechanical conditions, e. g., cold rolled, stress relieved, recrystallized, welded, biphasic, together with minority second phases belonging to the original material or incorporated due to in-service conditions. The anisotropic crystalline structure of zirconium is exploited in microscopical observations by means of polarizer filters that enhance the contrast between different grains, and greatly aid the identification in most microstructures. Most microstructural variations across a wide range of length-scales, such as those produced by welding processes, can be effectively resolved by traditional optical microscopy (OM). However, some finer microstructures like those found in CANDU1 (CANada Deuterium Uranium) reactor pressure tube material, or some minority second phase particles like the Zr(Fe, Cr)2 precipitates in Zircaloy-4 cannot be completely resolved by this technique. Thus, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are required in such cases. For SEM observations we show the valuable issue of the scale in specific microstructural studies, which allows quantifying microstructural parameters using image analysis. For TEM observations, we have greatly benefited from the electron diffraction diagrams, which have allowed us to investigate the crystalline structure of irradiated second phase particles, which would remain unnoticed to both, OM or SEM observations.}

Once nanoparticles have been synthesized and conveniently grafted onto a particular support, thiol removal might be required before its use. Here, thiolate and sulfur electrodesorption from nanoparticle and planar platinum surfaces are comparatively studied by combining ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical techniques. We show that alkanethiolates and sulfur adsorbed on Pt surfaces are more stable against reductive desorption than these species on Au substrates. Furthermore, for short-chain thiol-capped platinum nanoparticles we observe complete removal of sulfur-containing species. Hence, these results make this procedure suitable for its use in electrocatalysis. As an example, we demonstrate that 2 nm thiomalic acid-protected platinum nanoparticles markedly improve the performance of a hydrogen storage alloy material, with no additional steps in the preparation of the electrodes.},

A comparison is made between kinetic performance in a Sievert-type apparatus of pure Mg, Mg + xG (x = 5, 10, 20 wt.\%, G = graphite) composites and a mixture obtained by adding 10 wt.\% G to MgH2already synthesized via reactive mechanical milling. Moreover, the influence of two types of graphite morphology (flakes and fine powder) is evaluated. In addition, thermal dehydriding properties are analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and morphological and microstructural characteristics are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser granulometry, BET surface analysis as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) for every material under study. Graphite catalytic effect is independent of its morphology and is more pronounced when the additive is incorporated from the beginning of milling, as well as in a higher weight proportion. Furthermore, the additive preserves material microstructure during a few hydriding and dehydriding cycles, i.e. particle size distribution and crystallite enlargement, and as a result kinetic properties remain practically unchanged. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Two systems with similar microstructures (particle sizes dp ≈ 1–5 μm) are used to compare the effect of the crystal structure: the cubic La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ with La/Ba cations randomly distributed, and a tetragonal LaBaCo2O6-δ with La/Ba layered distribution. In addition, the effect of microstructure is studied by using a newsol-gel route which allows obtaining LaBaCo2O6-δ with smallest particle size (dp ≈ 500 nm). The electrode reaction isstudied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of temperature (T) and oxygen partial pressure (pO2). The electrode polarization resistance (RC,P) presents two contributions, a low frequency (RLF) and a high frequency Gerischer-resistance (RG). On one side, RLF, associated to the O2-gas diffusion across the gas layer boundary, presents low activation energy (Ea) and is proportional to pO2−1, presenting the same values regardless the microstructure.On the other side, RG is in agreement with anO2-reduction mechanismco-limited by O-surface exchange and O-bulk diffusion. RG is strongly influenced by structure (trough the diffusion coefficient DV) and microstructure (inversely proportional to dp). Besides, RG decreases by reducing dp and by modifying the La/Ba ordering from layered to randomly distributed.},

  abstract = {Remarkable regularities in the behaviour of the binding energy versus distance function (BEDF) of solids were reported years ago by Rose, Ferrante and Smith (RFS). In various phenomena, such as adhesion, chemisorption and bulk cohesion, it was possible to scale the binding energy and the interatomic distance so that data for various systems could be described by the same, “universal”, binding energy relation (UBER). At the 1995 Ringberg Workshop on Unary Data (Calphad 19 (1995) 538) it was recommended that the RFS approach should be considered as an alternative for correlating and predicting cohesive properties, as well as the parameters of the equation of state of solids (EOS). This possibility has been explored by us, using theoretical information on the energy versus volume relations at zero kelvin, that has been obtained in tight-binding linearized-muffin-tin-orbitals (TB-LMTO) calculations. The cohesive energy, equilibrium volume, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative (Be′) have been obtained for elements of the second row of the periodic table, viz., Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd and Ag, in the bcc, fcc and hcp structures. With this extensive database a critical test of the hypothesis of “universality” has been carried out. Moreover, the applicability of the RFS approach in predicting Be′ has been examined. The results for stable phases have been compared with experimental data. Finally, the structure dependence of Be′ has been discussed, which is a key issue in dealing with the EOS of non-stable structures of the elements.},

It is shown that the SID in this phase correlates remarkably well with the single bond length D(1) given to these elements by Pauling's bond length (BL) versus bond number relation. The physical relevance of this result, which holds for stable and metastable Ω phases, lies in the identification of the quantity D(1), which for metallic elements has long represented only a useful empirical parameter, to be used in the analysis and prediction of BLs, with a structural property that can be either directly measured, or accurately calculated by current ab initio methods.},

The size and distribution of the precipitates were examined by transmission electron microscopy at different locations of the pearlitic matrix. Some areas were nearly free from precipitates, while other regions showed precipitates at the cementite and ferrite lamellae and at the ferrite/cementite interface. Calculation of the thermodynamic equilibrium under stable and metastable conditions using Thermo-Calc led to the identification of the conditions controlling the formation of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates along three different stages depending on the Cu concentration. Together with a differential scanning calorimetry test and elemental diffusional calculations, thermodynamic predictions supported the observation of Cu-rich precipitates despite the low concentration of Cu of the alloy investigated and allowed the authors to explain the observed heterogeneity in the distribution of precipitates as resulting from the heterogeneous distribution of Cu in the alloy caused by microsegregation during solidification. The knowledge gained is relevant for the design of strengthening strategies in SGI based on the dispersion of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates.},

Dislocations with Burgers vector [1 0 0]βand line direction [1 1 1]βin an isotropic β matrix are considered. The model takes into account the interaction between the martensitic stress-free transformation strains and the stress field created by the dislocation arrays. It is shown that the interaction is different for each twin-related variant in the γ′ martensite. The energy necessary to maintain the right volume relationship of the twinned γ′ variants to produce an undistorted β/γ′ habit plane is defined as the inhibition energy.

  abstract = {Nanocrystalline Ce0.8Zr0.2O2solid-solutions (CZ) were synthesized by microemulsion (ME80), co-precipitation (CP80) and co-precipitation followed by supercritical CO2post-treatment (SC80). Structural, microstructural and textural characterizations of oxides were performed and correlated with their redox properties. The results are consistent with the formation of solid solutions with high surface area (SBET∼ 200 m2g-1), constituted by nanoparticles (4-6 nm) with a fluorite type structure but different mesoporosity. Dynamic oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements indicate that the presence of Pd improves the extension of reduction of CZ support, with the higher low-temperature OSC capacity observed for Pd/SC80. Static kinetics measurements, confirm that Pd promotes hydrogen spillover onto CZ favoring both surface and bulk reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) even at 373 K. Pd/SC80 presents considerably higher total OSC (691 versus 400-454 μmol H2g-1) with respect to the other samples. Significant Pd sintering was observed over Pd/ME80 only, with the consequent decrease of redox capability for Pd/ME80 catalyst. On the contrary, Pd/CP80 and Pd/SC80 samples presented highly dispersed Pd and good stability after redox cycling. These findings indicate that CP followed by thermal treatment under supercritical conditions is a promising method to synthesize materials with high low temperature OSC and promissory redox properties due to improved Pd/CZ interaction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to explore the low-frequency spectrum of 5N pure copper in a subresonant pendulum which allows "in situ" cycled torsion deformation and recovery. Samples were taken from the same single crystals used for ultrasonic attenuation studies in order to compare both results in an Arrhenius plot. In one sample prepared by electro-erosion, polished with nitric acid, recovered 4 hours at 650°C in preliminary vacuum and 1,4 and 9\% deformed at room temperature, the spectra show a main Bordoni peak whose height increases with deformation, and additional peaks in the 40-65K range, as important as the Bordoni peak, which are due to impurities generated during the preparation of the sample. In an uncontaminated sample cut by diamond disk, polished with a mixture of nitric, phosphoric and glacial acetic acids, and water, recovered in 5.10.\textasciitilde{} mmHg vacuum, deformed 3 and 5\%, the internal friction spectra show the main Bordoni peak as the principal effect, accompanied by a defect modulus. The study of the influence of different parameters such as the amount of deformation, the amplitude and frequency of oscillation, the temperature rate and the recoveries may be an interesting contribution to the characterization of the Bordoni peak.},

  abstract = {A method for the determination of nitrogen in solid solution using internal friction in ion-implanted and diffusion-doped pure α-Fe is presented. It also allows the indirect determination of some combined nitrogen (Fe nitride concentration). The method consists in measuring the Snoek relaxation during isotherms at low frequencies in a subresonant forced pendulum. Chemical analysis by a vacuum fusion technique is necessary to check the proportionality factor between the height of the internal friction peak and the interstitial nitrogen content. It is assumed that the polycrystalline samples are not textured and that the nitrogen is completely dissolved by annealing in an inert atmosphere. This kind of evaluation could be useful for characterizing b.c.c. metals in relation to certain applications where mechanical properties could be altered by the free nitrogen content.},

  abstract = {In the last anelastic torsion studies in (TaSe4)2I, in the hertz range, we found two other effects in addition to the 265 K (1 Hz) Peierls transition. One is an anomaly in the shear modulus and internal friction at 50–60K, observed only when increasing the temperature in an helium gas atmosphere (from 200 to 600 mmHg). This anomaly is not thermally activated and has an energy of 0.05 eV measured from the internal friction width, being therefore attributed to the helium movement by a tunneling process between its positions in the lattice.The other is an internal friction peak superposed with a temperature-dependent background which encloses a step in the modulus, as a typical defect-relaxation phenomenon. It does not depend on the atmosphere inside the pendulum, as confirmed by changing from rough vacuum to helium, argon and nitrogen atmospheres, without changes in the spectra. The energy around 1 eV, the temperature peak 270 K (1 Hz) and the iodine excess composition respect to the stoichiometric one, allow us to propose it as an iodine point-defect relaxation.},

  abstract = {The ferroelasticity, or more commonly the rubber effect, has been studied in Cu–14.4 at.\% Zn–16.8 at.\% Al single crystals. The 18R single crystals were stress induced in tension at various temperatures, and then aged in the martensitic state for given temperatures and times. Afterwards compressive stresses were applied, leading to the diffusionless transformation to another 18R martensitic variant, which on unloading retransformed back to the original variant. This process is associated with a corresponding shape change. It has been observed that initially the transformation stress increases with annealing time, until a plateau is reached, followed by another increase at larger times. From the influence of the ageing temperature on the velocity of the change in the transformation stress an activation energy of 67 kJ/mol is derived. This value is lower than that controlling the stabilization of the martensite with respect to the β phase matrix of 97 kJ/mol, and implies that the mechanism which is responsible for the rubber like behaviour is different from that for stabilization. The reason for this is discussed and a possible interpre-tation is given.},

The different stages of milling were identified and characterized as initial, intermediate, final, and completion. The obtained microstructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The evolution of the microstructure was studied considering the particle size variation. A decrease in the particle size was found as the Al content increases. The evolution of the nanostructure was studied considering the grain size variation. No marked changes on the nanostructure were detected during milling regardless either the type of mill used or composition selected. Mean grain sizes’ values found were between 10 nm and 26 nm for each stage of milling. Power consumption of the milling process was calculated at laboratory scale to analyze the chances of a potential scaling up of the milling process. Starting aggregation state, microstructure and dominant phase changes, and evolution of mechanical alloying stages were considered. Performance of milling was compared to traditional high-temperature methods to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both synthesis methods.},

  abstract = {© 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. All rights reserved. Releasing and deployment maneuvers carried out during space satellites launching are usually performed by utilizing pyrotechnics loads. However, it is considered convenient to replace this technique by others not requiring explosives (Non Explosive Actuators-NEA). This is mainly due to the necessity of reducing high-shock and vibrations induced levels, also avoiding the contamination of sensible instruments because of dust and gas release during explosion. In addition, the avoidance of risks associated with storage and manipulation of explosives and the possibility of performing device retesting prior to final mounting are desirable qualities. Among NEA devices, those exploiting the singular mechanical behavior of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) have reached commercial maturity. In this study, the performance of a NEA device that uses the mechanical stress generated upon reverse transformation of a mechanically constrained SMA actuator (constrained recovery effect) to generate the controlled fracture of a notched bolt is analyzed. Firstly, the mechanical components of the system are described, and the main problems associated with its design are introduced. Then, the results of the experimental characterization performed on a NiTi SMA cylindrical tube actuator with 12.7 and 7.8 mm outer and inner diameter respectively, are presented. After an activation stage in which the cylinder is compressed to induce the martensitic phase (or re-orient the existing martensític phase), the temperature is raised while a constant displacement condition is imposed. For temperatures near 120 °C, a loads increment of 35 kN (440 MPa) is obtained. The repetition of this loading-unloading-heating-cooling cycle does not generate any important deterioration in the material response.},

  abstract = {When the full stock of a new product is quickly sold in a few days or weeks, one has the impression that new technologies develop and conquer the market in a very easy way. This may be true for some new technologies, for example the cell phone, but not for others, like the blue-ray. Novelty, usefulness, advertising, price, and fashion are the driving forces behind the adoption of a new product. But, what are the key factors that lead to adopt a new technology? In this paper we propose and investigate a simple model for the adoption of an innovation which depends mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the interaction with other agents. Social interactions are taken into account in two ways: by imitation and by differentiation, i.e., some agents will be inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same, but other will act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate from the "herd". We determine the conditions for a successful implantation of the new technology, by considering the strength of advertising and the effect of social interactions. We find a balance between the advertising and the number of anti-herding agents that may block the adoption of a new product. We also compare the effect of social interactions, when agents take into account the behavior of the whole society or just a part of it. In a nutshell, the present model reproduces qualitatively the available data on adoption of innovation.},

  abstract = {The bce --{$>$}Ohm phase transition is diffusionless: two-thirds of the atoms in the (111) planes of the bcc phase collapse into double layers, whereas the third remains a single layer. This transformation is observed in the group-IV elements Ti, Zr, and Hf at high pressure, but it may be induced at zero pressure by quenching the samples at room temperature in alloys of these elements with other transition metals (TM's). This paper presents a systematic theoretical study of the bcc--{$>$}Ohm transformation in Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo using the full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method. Equilibrium volumes, total-energy differences, density of electron states, and the band structure of Y, Zr, Nh, and Mo in the stable and metastable bcc and Ohm structures are presented. In addition, the bcc--{$>$}Ohm energy difference is studied as a function of the specific lattice distortion as well as of pressure. These results are related to a picture that involves the softening of the (2/3,2/3,2/3) longitudinal phonon mode. Charge-density calculations are performed for both the bcc and Ohm phases, and the electronic contributions that stiffen the bcc lattice against the Ohm distortion are identified. The physical picture of the electronic and chemical bonding effects emerging from the present work should be useful in understanding the observed trends in the relative stability of the Ohm phase in the TM's and their alloys.},

Their catalytic properties were studied in the metal-catalyzed reaction of cyclohexane dehydrogenation (300°C, 0.1MPa, WHSV=10h-1, H2/C6H12=30), the acid-catalyzed isomerization of n-butane (350°C, 0.1MPa, WHSV=1h-1, H2/C4H10=6), and the bifunctional hydroconversion of n-octane (300°C, 1.5MPa, WHSV=4h-1, H2/C8H18=6). TPR, XRD and FTIR of chemisorbed CO were also used in order to characterize the catalysts. The results showed a strong influence of the crystal phase on the activity of the acid function. A less marked effect was found for the metal-catalyzed reaction. An opposite relation between the two functions was seen with respect to this crystal structure influence. Among the sulfated catalysts, monoclinic Pt/SO42--ZrO2had the lowest activity in n-C4isomerization and the highest activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Tetragonal Pt/SO42--ZrO2catalysts were the most active in isomerization of n-butane. They had the lowest activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation and their metal properties were negligible. They were also the most active in n-C8conversion, producing mainly i-C4. Monoclinic catalysts had low cracking activity and produced mainly isooctane. Mixed phase catalysts had an intermediate behavior. While S poisoning of Pt was present as a uniform effect on all sulfated catalysts, the metal-acid behavior and the different Pt properties could be explained by a metal-support interaction between tetragonal SO42--ZrO2and Pt. The Pt-support interaction was analyzed both with a model of Pt particles encapsulation and a model of electron depletion. The electronic deficiency of Pt particles supported on SO42--ZrO2was evident in the shift of the IR bands of adsorbed CO. Further experimental work is however needed to get conclusive evidence about the nature of the Pt-support interaction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tungsten has several unusual thermodynamic properties, e.g., very high values of the melting point, the entropy of fusion, the expansion on melting and the lattice anharmonicity. These features are given a semiquantitative explanation, based on the electron density of states N(E). Our treatment includes a numerical calculation of the electronic heat capacity from N(E) and a calculation of the entropy Debye temperature FTHETAS(T) from the vibrational part of the experimental heat capacity. FTHETAS(T) decreases by 36\% from 300 K to the melting temperature 3695 K, the largest drop in FTHETAS for elemental metals. Recent quantum-mechanical ab initio calculations of the difference, Hβ/α, in Gibbs energy at T=0 K between the metastable fcc tungsten and the stable bcc phase yield Hβ/α=50±5 kJ/mol, which is much larger than the ‘‘experimental’’ values Hβ/α=10 and 19 kJ/mol derived from previous semiempirical analyses [the so-called calculation of phase diagrams (‘‘CALPHAD’’) method] of binary phase diagrams containing tungsten. We have reanalyzed CALPHAD data, using the results of the first part of this paper. Because of the shapes of N(E) of α-W and β-W, some usually acceptable CALPHAD procedures give misleading results. We give several estimates of Hβ/α, using different assumptions about the hypothetical melting temperature Tfβ of fcc W. The more realistic of our estimates gives Hβ/α=30 kJ/mol or larger, thus reducing considerably the previous discrepancy between CALPHAD and ab initio results. The physical picture emerging from this work should be of importance in refinements of the CALPHAD method.},

  abstract = {We systematize available thermodynamic information on transition metal diborides, with emphasis on the enthalpy of formation, the vibrational entropy and the melting temperature. When experimental information is lacking, e.g., for metastable compounds, we obtain estimates through interpolation and extrapolation procedures introduced by us. Our results are used, i.a., to account for the change from stable to metastable transition metal diborides as one proceeds along a transition‐metal line in the Periodic Table. Our method of analysis combines available experimental thermodynamic and lattice–parameter data with CALPHAD calculations of phase diagrams and knowledge from solid state theory on electron states and lattice vibrations. An important point in the analysis is that in the high‐temperature vibrational entropy, atomic masses are separated from the interatomic forces. That allows us to introduce a quantity with the dimension of energy, which depends only on the electronic structure and shows a regular behavior along a transition metal row in the Periodic Table, and moreover co‐varies with the enthalpy of formation of the compounds. Thus we can study the trends in the Gibbs energy G=H−TS of the diborides and account for the systematics of their stability properties.},

  abstract = {The “Calphad approach” refers to a method for assessment of thermodynamic information which combines an analysis of experimental data using phenomenological models for the Gibbs energy G = H - TS and calculations of phase diagrams.1 The models contain parameters (e.g., interaction energies) which are determined by searching for the best fit to the thermodynamic information. The analysis is carried out iteratively, using computerized optimization techniques which allow the simultaneous treatment of various types of experimental data. In the optimization, each measured value is given a certain weight, which reflects the probable accuracy, and the extent to which that piece of information is allowed to influence the optimum parameter values. The weights are chosen by personal judgement at the start of the work, but they are changed systematically during the assessment until most of the reliable information is well reproduced by the model parameters. In addition to the assessment techniques for measured values, the Calphad activity has led to the development of extrapolation procedures for thermodynamic properties of alloys that can be used to treat some metastable compounds and phases that are poorly known from experiments, e.g., in higher-order systems.},

A wide range of chemical compositions (13.7 {$<$} Mn {$<$} 27.5 wt.\% and 0 {$<$} Cr {$<$} 12.4 wt.\%) has been studied. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted in order to confirm that the martensitic transformation takes place between an fcc structure and the hcp martensite. Transition temperatures were measured by means of electrical resistivity and dilatometry. All transition temperatures tend to decrease with the increment in Cr content while the addition of Mn decreases the MTTs and increases TN. These different effects and the stabilization effect of the antiferromagnetic ordering on the fcc austenite result in different MTTs behaviors depending on whether the martensitic transition occurs from a magnetically ordered austenite or not. For these later cases, a phenomenological model of MTTs is presented that could be of use for alloys design.},

  abstract = {Several strategies to increase the FCC austenite stability compared to BCC and HCP martensites have been tested and are discussed. The relative stability of the different phases was analyzed by studying the effects of: a) grain size, b) antiferromagnetic ordering of the austenite, c) thermal cycling through the FCC-HCP transition, d) plastic deformation of the austenite and e) combined effects. As a first step, the effect of decreasing the grain size was analyzed in Fe–Mn alloys for Mn contents smaller than 18 wt.\%, where BCC and HCP martensites compete in stability. Formation of the BCC phase is inhibited for 15 wt.\% and 17 wt.\% of Mn for grain sizes smaller than 2 μm. This enabled, for the first time at these compositions, the measurement of the Néel temperature of the austenite using specific heat and magnetic measurements. A comparison of the obtained transition temperatures with accepted models is discussed. The effect of modifying the grain size on the FCC-HCP transition temperatures was also analyzed for 15 wt.\% and 17 wt.\% Mn contents showing a complete HCP inhibition for grain sizes smaller than 200 nm. A nucleation model for the HCP martensite is considered which includes an additional resistance to the transformation term depending on the austenitic grain size. Additional combined effects on the FCC stabilization are discussed like the interaction between the antiferromagnetic ordering and the introduction of defects by thermal cycling through the martensitic transformation. The analysis can be easily applied to systems with a larger number of components. Results obtained in the Fe–Mn–Cr system are also presented.},

The properties of the Co-C and W-C systems are taken from recent analyses, whereas the properties of the Co-W system are evaluated in the first part of the present work. In particular, the effect of W in decreasing the Curie temperature of fcc Co (Tc) is evaluated from recent solubility data, by using the Hillert-Jarl model for magnetic Gibbs energy. Our evaluation gives a less dramatic effect of W on Tc than according to early work, but strong enough to produce a magnetic miscibility gap in the fcc phase. A new phase diagram for the Co-W system, showing the immiscibility effects, is presented. The properties of the fcc, hcp, and bcc phases, two ternary carbides (M12C and M6C), and the liquid phase in the Co-W-C system are evaluated in the second part. Various isothermal and vertical sections, and a projection of the liquidus surface of the Co-W-C diagram are reported.

The analysis reveals large explicit anharmonic effects. When plotted versus the reduced temperature T/Tf, various quantities of Mo and W related to anharmonicity show a striking similarity.

This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of a generalized form of the equation, based on treating all its various parameters [viz., V, B, and (∂B/∂P) T  at P=0] as functions of temperature. Extending a previous study, the effect of T upon (∂B/∂P) T  is accounted for by using a dimensionless parameter introduced by us, which is used in formulating general expressions for the volume dependence of various thermophysical quantities, viz., the thermal expansion coefficient (α), the product αB, and the Grüneisen and Anderson-Grüneisen parameters. Some combinations of these parameters are identified, which show a simple dependence upon P. The new expressions are used in analyzing current approximations and the behavior of the solid in the low-compression range. In particular, an expression for α at high P is reported which generalizes the Anderson equation and previous results by us. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

We consider trends in the melting temperature, the enthalpy of formation and lattice vibration properties as the metal Me varies along the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal series. The trends show a consistent picture which can be explained from the electronic density of states by a rigid-band like argument. This fact gives us confidence to apply the regularities and obtain new information by interpolation and extrapolation procedures. In particular, we estimate the standard entropy S⊖ at 298.15 K for stable AlB2 structure compounds where there are no previous measurements and for some metastable compounds (Me ≡ Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Mo, Tc, WandRe). The results are compared with estimates based on various empirical methods. In the Me-B systems, the MeB2 phase may be stable at all temperatures, or be a high-temperature phase or a metastable phase. We explain the observed trend. Through the use of thermodynamic phase diagram calculations (the so-called CALPHAD method), we study the thermodynamic properties of the metastable AlB2 structure phase FeB2.},

Direct and indirect experimental information is used. For systems where experimental data are lacking, we rely on interpolation and extrapolation procedures, assuming that the bonding properties vary smoothly as a function of the average number of valence electrons per atom in the compound, ne,. In 0S the atomic masses enter in such a way that they can be taken into consideration exactly, and only an appropriate averaged interatomic force constant ks needs to be estimated. The systematic variations with ne were previously noted by us in 3rd-transition metal carbides and nitrides (Fernández Guillermet and Grimvall, Phys. Rev. B40, 10,582 (1989)), and can be theoretically understood through an electron-band filling argument. That approach is considerably extended in the present work. Many of the compounds studied are metastable, i.e. the phase does not appear in the stable metal-carbon phase diagram. This fact is used as important indirect information which, together with our estimated entropy, gives limits to Δ0H of metastable carbides through CALPHAD calculations of phase diagrams. Our results are summarized in tables of the room-temperature enthalpy of formation Δ0H, the entropy Debye temperature θs, the corresponding average interatomic force constant ks and the standard vibrational entropy 0S(298.15). Δ0H is in good general agreement with predictions from Miedema's formula, with some small but significant differences. The general plcture of the cohesion in the carbides suggests important p−d bonding for Sc, Ti and V compounds, with a maximum strength for TiC, and weaker and more metallic bonding in Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni carbides.},

Films with thickness of ≈5 μm with micrometric grains show martensitic transformation temperature and hysteresis values close to the ones found in bulk samples. This result is different to the one found in Cu-Zn-Al thin films with 18R martensitic structure and similar microstructure, in which the hysteresis presents an increment (≈10 times) compared to bulk samples. This difference can be associated to the intrinsic nature of the 2H transformation which requires more undercooling to produce the nucleation of the martensitic phase. The driving force for the burst-type martensitic transformation decreases the influence of the microstructure in the transformation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this way a controlled amount of Zn is transported from the bulk reference into the film, in such a way that the Ms of the film becomes nearly the same as the bulk reference.

We consider NaCl-structure compounds, MC and MN, as well as carbides and nitrides with more complex crystal structures. The enthalpies of formation at zero temperature Δ0H(0) of the MC and MN compounds are taken from previous ab initio linear-muffin-tin-oribtals calculations. We describe the structure as formed by a metal fcc lattice in which nonmetal atoms have been inserted at interstitial positions. Δ0H(0) is divided into contributions from (i) formation of metallic fcc lattice, (ii) expansion of this lattice to the lattice spacing of the compound, and (iii) insertion of nonmetal atoms into the metal lattice. Δ0H(0), plotted versus the position of M in the d series, shows a pronounced maximum for the Ti, Zr, and Hf carbides. In agreement with other work, we interpret this as due to the filling of bonding p-d hybridized states. The maximum in Δ0H(0) is followed first by a decrease and then by an almost constant value. We interpret this as an effect of a gradual population of antibonding and nonbonding electronic states. Size effects, i.e., contribution (ii), are small for the 4d- and 5d-series compounds. Δ0H(0) of MN is similar to that of MC, but the largest values occur for M=Sc,Y,La since N has one more valence electron than C. Bonding in the complex carbides and nitrides is given an analogous interpretation.},

The corresponding cyclic flow stress components, the friction, σF, and the back stresses, σB, have been analyzed in relation to the observed microstructure. σF attains higher values at room temperature than in the intermediate range of temperatures in both thermal conditions due to the influence of the lattice friction stress on screw dislocations in the ferrite phase. The cyclic softening observed at all temperatures in aged samples is caused by the decrease of the back stress σB. The increase of σB in unaged samples at 300°C is consistent with the high dislocation density observed in the ferrite phase ascribed as a typical manifestation of dynamic strain aging.}

  abstract = {This work presents the microstructural changes of a carbon steel during tempering at low temperatures (first stage of tempering), and its effects in the second and third stages. These changes are determined by internal friction. Internal friction is measured in a forced vibration mode at 5 Hz, in a temperature range from 300 to 600K. Four internal friction peaks appear: S1 at 350K, P1 at 380K, P2 at 440K, P3 at 480K. S1 only appears in the sample tempered at 380K for 20 hours, and this can be related to the reduction of the martensite tetragonality. The height of P1 is lowest when the intensity of tempering is increased. This height can be related to the quantity of epsilon carbide than precipitate. The heights of P2 and P3 are not changed significantly, but the difference of temperature between both is lowest when the tempering intensity is increased. This suggests than the dissolution of epsilon carbide and formation of cementite takes places in a lowest range of temperature. Keywords:},

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior of quenched and tempered steels is analyzed by mechanical spectroscopy (internal friction), hardness measurements, Charpy impact and tensile mechanical tests. In quenched steels, the high dislocation density leads to a stress relaxation mainly based on the Snoek-Köster relaxation, and inhibits the plastic deformation, leading to a predominantly intergranular mechanism of fracture. During tempering, the martensite decomposition decreases the dislocation density and hardness. This leads to a stress relaxation based on both dislocation-enhanced Snoek and Snoek-Koster relaxations, and promotes the fracture mechanism transition from brittle to ductile. This suggests that the Snoek-Köster and dislocation-enhanced Snoek relaxations are correlated with the intergranular and ductile fracture mechanisms, respectively. Nevertheless, the tempered martensite embrittlement cannot be detected by means of internal friction since the strain rate associated to this technique is more similar to the strain rate observed in tensile mechanical test than that observed in Charpy impact test. On the other hand, the risk of embrittlement is increased when the retained austenite is thermally instable.},

On one hand, the decrease of the amplitude of a local maximum at 380. K is correlated with the reduction of interstitial carbon content in the martensite matrix, which is due to the carbide precipitation during the first stage of tempering. On the other hand, the amplitude change of an internal friction peak that appears at 500. K is correlated to the variation of the dislocation density. Both amplitude variations follow a similar trend during quenching and tempering, indicating a correlation between the interstitial carbon content and dislocation density in martensite.

In home made systems for special purposes, the instrumentation available nowadays suggests that it is possible to use non-differential conduction calorimeters. In order to prove this, a simple and cheap design was constructed and tested. A sensitivity of 700 mV/W near 298 K (in agreement with the detecting semiconductors), a noise around 0.3 μW and a long time fluctuation of the base line lower than 1 μW were obtained. The reliability of the system was evaluated by analyzing the changes of single crystals of Cu-Zn-Al Shape Memory Alloys after different thermal treatments. The calorimeter allowed the determination of a reproducible set of time constants related to the heat treatments and to the mass (or shape) of the sample. It is concluded that the experimental configuration used is suitable for this isothermal analysis.},

Damping in civil engineering is needed to minimize earthquake effects on buildings, and also to limit the damage produced by wind or traffic induced oscillations in stayed cables in bridges. In this work, we explore the consequences of strain aging the material at moderate temperatures (100. °C). A quasi-static stress and temperature aging of NiTi SMA wires of 2.46. mm diameter was done at 373. K. The experimental measurements establish a monotonic effect related to the introduced strain. Aging under larger strains modifies the hysteretic shape and induces an increase in the maximal stress on the transformation from 600. MPa to 800-1000. MPa. Aging at 373. K under 7-8\% strain, the effect was up to 200. MPa in three months and near 400. MPa in eight months. The modified stress-strain curves suggest potential application as dampers under larger summer-winter temperature changes, i.e., from 233 to 323. K.},

Functional fatigue affecting superelastic behaviour of NiTi wires includes an accumulation of residual strain and an uneven decrement of transformation stress on cycling. Although this evolution is observed to diminish asymptotically, it represents an important loss in the maximum recoverable strain level and in the hysteretic dissipative capacity of the material. In this work, the effect of moderate temperature aging treatment on the functionally degraded material properties was studied with two experimental setups. NiTi pseudoelastic wire samples of 0.5 and 2.46 mm diameter were subjected to different cycling programs intercalated by aging treatments of different durations up to 48 h at 100°C. Results show that important levels of recovery on the residual strains and the transformation stresses were attained after the aging treatments. The analysis indicates that the characteristics of the recovered cycles are rather independent from the treatment duration and from the reached condition before each treatment.},

According to the results obtained by DSC and load-biased thermal-cycling measurements, the TRC strip is more stable and has lower residual strain than the SC strip for loads below 90 MPa. Using the austenitic texture of each strip, the recoverable strain upper bounds of the martensitic transformation (Sachs' bound) were calculated.

It consists in the generation of a virtual dog-boned shaped specimen combined with the use of snubbing type of gripping action in order to completely eliminate earlier failures induced by grip-sample interactions. The generation of a virtual dog-boned specimen is based on the localized character of the stress induced martensitic transformation and the evolution of the transformation stresses with further cycling. Reduced pseudoelastic cycles are performed to evaluate functional and structural fatigue with this method. Consistent longer fatigue lives have been obtained compared to traditional gripping methods with fractures occurring inside the region of interest. The present study clearly points to the role of the stress induced transformation in determining the fatigue life. This treatment of the structural fatigue considerable departs from classical approaches but takes into account essential facts like the localized character of the stress induced transformation, the heat effects associated with the first order solid to solid martensitic transformation and its impact on the critical transformation stresses.},

Two types of experiments have been considered to elucidate the question. In the first class, the stress range was kept in between the forward and reverse plateaus levels, thus avoiding evident martensitic stress induced transformation. Strain controlled experiments were performed in wires in fully austenite, fully stress induced martensite and austenite–martensite coexistence zone with nearly half of the wire length transformed to martensite. In the second type of experiments, pseudoelastic cycling was performed. In this case the stress induced austenite to martensite transformation is involved. The obtained results indicate a definite deleterious effect of the stress induced transformation on the fatigue life. Additional important aspects related with fatigue life of NiTi wires like fretting fatigue effects in the grip–specimen contact region and the relative importance of the crack initiation and crack propagation stages on the total fatigue life are also presented.},

  abstract = {In the present work, an innovative methodology for characterizing structural fatigue of NiTi superelastic wires is proposed. It consists in, firstly, performing low speed nearly isothermal pseudoelastic cycles in a limited region of the wire specimen. This results in the stabilization of the pseudooelastic behavior accompanied by a decrease in the stresses for forward and reverse transformations which allows obtaining an equivalent to a geometric dog-bone shaped specimen due to the reduced transformation stresses in the pre-cycled region. In a second stage, by limiting the transformation active zone to the pre-cycled region, the deformation speed can be increased to practical values avoiding any transformation activity outside that region. In that way, grip induced failures resulting in artificially shorter fatigue lives might be completely avoided thus allowing an accurate characterization of the true structural fatigue. Additionally, strain controlled experiments on wires in fully austenite and fully martensite states have been performed. Resulting fatigue lives in these cases were at least two orders of magnitude higher compared with the pseudoelastic fatigue indicating the decisive role played by the stress induced transformation in determining fatigue life. The influence of testing temperature and deformation rate on fatigue life has also been evaluated},

  abstract = {Since reactor pressure vessel steels are ferromagnetic, provide a convenient means to monitor changes in the mechanical properties of the material upon irradiation with high energy particles, by measuring their magnetic properties. Here, we discuss the correlation between mechanical and magnetic properties and microstructure, by studying the flux effect on the nuclear pressure vessel steel used in reactors currently under construction in Argentina. Charpy-V notched specimens of this steel were irradiated in the RA1 experimental reactor at 275°C with two lead factors (LFs), 93 and 183. The magnetic properties were studied by means of DC magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance. The results show that the coercive field and magnetic anisotropy spatial distribution are sensitive to the LF and can be explained by taking into account the evolution of the microstructure with this parameter. The saturation magnetization shows a dominant dependence on the accumulated damage. Consequently, the mentioned techniques are suitable to estimate the degradation of the reactor vessel steel. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of formation of the Widmanstätten plates which have recently been found in chromium-rich CrNi alloys, and are quite similar to the typical “Bainitic” plates in copper and silver based alloys, is discussed here by combining experimental data on the composition ofthe Widmanstätten plate with thermodynamic calculations of the stable and metastable phase equilibria. The observed nickel concentration of the Widmanstätten plate is about 30 mass\% higher than that of the original b.c.c. (α) matrix, but it is about 4 mass\% smaller than that of the f.c.c. (γ) phase in equilibrium with the b.c.c. phase at the start of the plate formation. The possibility of plate-formation mechanisms based on martensitic transformations from b.c.c. or to f.c.c. or from b.c.c. to a metastable phase with the so-called 3R structure is unambiguously excluded from thermodynamic considerations. The precipitation of the metastable phase with the 3R structure is proposed as the most probable mechanism of Widmanstätten plate formation. This mechanism explains the composition of the plate as well as the temperature range and the region of alloy compositions, where the Widmanstätten plate formation has been observed. Nous discutons dans cet article le mécanisme de formation des plaquettes de Widmanstätten qui ont été observées récemment dans des alliages NiCr riches en chrome, et qui sont tout à fait semblables aux plaquettes “bainitiques” typiques dans les alliages à base de cuivre ou d'argent. Cette discussion combine à la fois des résultats expérimentaux sur la composition des plaquettes de Widmanstätten, et des calculs thermodynamiques sur les équilibres de phases stables et métastables. La concentration expérimentale en nickel de la plaquette de Widmanstätten est d'environ 30\% (en masse) supérieure à celle de la la matrice c.c. (α) de départ, mais elle est 4\% environ inférieure à celle de la phase c.f.c. (γ) qui est en équilibre avec la phase c.c. au début de la formation de la plaquette. Des considerations thermodynamiques permettent d'éliminer sans ambiguïté la possibilité des mécanismes de formation des plaquettes basés sur des transformations martensitiques c.c.→c.f.c., ou c.c.→ phase métastable de structure 3R. Nous proposons comme mécanisme de formation le plus probable la précipitation de cette phase métastable de structure 3R. Ce mécanisme explique la composition de la plaquette ainsi que la gamme de températures et le domaine de composition des alliages où l'on observe la formation des plaquettes de Widmanstätten. Die Bildungsmechanismen der vor kurzem in Cr-reichen CrNi-Legierungen gefundenen Widmannstätten-Platten werden hier untersucht. Diese Platten ähneln den typischen “Bainit”-Platten in Legierungen auf Kupfer- und Silber-Basis sehr. Zur Untersuchung werden experimentelle Bestimmungen der Zusammensetzung der Platten mit thermodynamischen Berechnungen der stabilen und metastabilen Phasengleichgewichte kombiniert. Die beobachtete Nickelknozentration der Widmannstätten-Platten liegt etwa 30 Massen-\% höher als in der ursprünglichen krz. (α-) Matrix, ist aver etwa 4 Massen-\% niedriger als in der kfx. (γ-) Phase, die zu Beginn der Plattenbildung mit der krz. Phase im Gleichgewicht steht. Die Möglichkeit, daβ sich die Platten über einen Mechanismus bilden, der auf martensitischen Umwandlungen von krz. zu kfz. oder von krz. zu einer metastabilen Phase mit der sogenannten 3R-Struktur beruht, wird aus thermodynamischen überlegungen heraus eindeutig ausgeschlossen. Als wahrscheinlichster Prozeβ der Bildung der Widmannstätten-Platten wird die Ausscheidung der metastabilen Phase mit der 3R-Struktur angesehen. Dieser Mechanismus erklärt die Zusammensetzung der Platte wie auch den Temperaturbereich und den Bereich der Legierungszusammensetzung, in denen die Bildung der Widmannstätten-Platten beobachtet worden ist.},

  abstract = {Ultrafine-grained (UFG) Al matrix composites reinforced with 15 and 30vol\% in-situ Al3Ti filaments were fabricated by extrusion of Al-Ti powder mixtures followed by solid-state reactive diffusion. Fine Al powder particles (1.3μm) heavily deformed the coarser Ti particles (24.5μm) into filaments during extrusion. Upon a subsequent operation of hot isostatic pressing (HIP), the micrometric Al3Ti filaments elongated along the extrusion direction and formed in situ in the UFG Al matrix. Fabricated composites are free of pores and voids with perfect bonding created at the Al-Al3Ti interfaces. In parallel, a small portion (2.4vol\%) of nanoscale γ-Al2O3 particles, which originate from native amorphous films on fine Al powders, formed in situ and were homogenously dispersed in the Al matrix. The microstructures of as-extruded and after HIP composites were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). Owing to the presence of nanometric γ-Al2O3 particles with Al high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), the UFG Al matrix remained stable even after HIP at 600°C for 9h. The mechanical properties and creep performance of composites at testing temperatures of up to 600°C were systematically studied. The Al-Al3Ti composites exhibited a combination of increased strength and Young's modulus in addition to excellent creep performance and structural stability, which indicates that the studied composites are potential structural materials capable of service at elevated temperatures.},

While the network maintains solely local connections, certain properties known only to Small World Networks may be extracted due to the dynamic nature of the model. At each time step the individuals are grouped into clusters creating neighborhoods or domains of fully connected agents. The boundaries of these domains change in time, corresponding to a situation where the links between individuals are dynamic only throughout the history of the network. A question that we pose is whether our model, which maintains a local structure such that diffusion calculations are possible, might lead to analytic or conceptual advances for the much more complicated case of diffusion on a static disordered network that exhibits the same macroscopic properties as our dynamic ordered network. To answer this, we compare certain properties which characterize the dynamic domain network to those of a Small World Network, and then analyze the diffusion coefficients for three possible domain mutations. We close with a comparison and confirmation of previous epidemiological work carried out on networks.},

Both, experimental and numerical results show that at low velocities there is no dependence of the transition temperatures, whereas at higher speeds they gradually increase.

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In order to treat this phenomenon in thermodynamic terms it is necessary to account for the composition dependence of the Néel temperature (TN) of the alloy and the entropy change (ΔSmg) associated to the loss of the antiferromagnetic ordering. In the present work the composition dependence of these properties in Fe-Mn and Fe-Mn-Co alloys have been established by performing systematic measurements of the heat capacity.

  abstract = {© 2016 American Physical Society.Bimagnetic nanoparticles have been proposed for the design of new materials with controlled properties, which requires a comprehensive investigation of their magnetic behavior due to multiple effects arising from their complex structure. In this work we fabricated bimagnetic core/shell nanoparticles formed by an ∼3-nm antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO core encapsulated within an ∼1.5-nm ferrimagnetic (FiM) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 shell, aiming at studying the enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy and the surface effects of a ferrimagnetic oxide shell. The magnetic properties of as-synthesized and annealed samples were analyzed by ac and dc magnetization measurements. The results indicate that the magnetic response of the as-synthesized particles is governed by the superparamagnetic behavior of the interacting nanoaggregates of spins that constitute the disordered ferrimagnetic shell, whose total moments block at (TB)=49 K and collectively freeze in a superspin-glass-type state at (Tg)=3 K. On the other hand, annealed nanoparticles are superparamagnetic at room temperature and behave as an exchange-coupled system below the blocking temperature (TB)=70 K, with enhanced coercivity HC(10K)∼14.6 kOe and exchange bias field HEB(10K)∼2.3 kOe, compared with the as-synthesized system where HC(10K)∼5.5 kOe and HEB(10K)∼0.8 kOe. Our results, interpreted using different models for thermally activated and surface relaxation processes, can help clarify the complex magnetic behavior of many core/shell and hollow nanoparticle systems.},

We report the synthesis and the structural and magnetic characterization of bimagnetic CoO/CoFe2O4 core/shell nanoparticles. The material was fabricated by a seed-mediated growth high-temperature decomposition method with sizes in the range of 5-11 nm. We show that the core/shell morphology favours the crystallinity of the shell phase, and the reduction of the particle size leads to a remarkable increase of the magnetic hardening. When the size is reduced, the coercive field at 5 K increases from 21.5 kOe to 30.8 kOe, while the blocking temperature decreases from 388 K to 167 K. The size effects on the magnetic behaviour are described through a phenomenological model for strongly ferri-/antiferromagnetic coupled phases.},

  abstract = {The growth the GaAs/GaAlAs quantum wires by organometallic chemical vapor deposition on V-grooved substrates relies on the formation of a self-limiting AlGaAs surface profile and the thickness modulation in the form of a crescent of the GaAs layer. In order to gain understanding on the growth process at the atomic level, we developed a two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation based on the solid-on-solid model. In good agreement with experimental results, our kinetic model shows that the self-limited profile results from the competition between the growth rate anisotropy on the different facets of the groove and the surface diffusion of adatoms. The predictions of the growth modeling are experimentally employed to control at the nanometer scale the shape of quantum wires using successive changes in the growth conditions. This understanding of the growth mechanisms opens the way to an accurate control of the quantum confinement in quantum wires.},

  abstract = {The Nd60Fe30Al10alloy exhibits a large glass forming ability which allows to obtain relatively thick cast rods containing large volume fractions of amorphous phases. In this work the microstructure and the hard magnetic properties of as-cast rods are characterized. The alloy is processed by suction casting into a chilled copper mould to obtain cylinders 5 mm diameter and 50 mm length. This diameter is selected because it is an upper limit for this processing route, beyond which the hard properties largely deteriorate. A room temperature coercivity of 0.34 T is obtained. The sample microstructure is heterogeneous, with very different size scales near the surface and along the central zone. However, in both regions a large fraction of an amorphous ferromagnetic phase is observed; it is found that paramagnetic nanocrystalline phases - mainly Nd or Nd-rich particles, embedded in the amorphous matrix - are somewhat coarser in the central zone. These larger nanocrystals, less efficient to pin domain walls, are proposed to be responsible for the lower coercive fields observed, as compared with those found in cylinders 1-3 mm diameter where no inhomogeneities are found. This conclusion is supported by microstructure, calorimetric and magnetic observations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The first thermal stage, a microwave assisted denitration process, determines the shape of the structures.

A variety of techniques (scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy) allowed to fully characterize the microstructure and morphology of these self-standing manganite nanostructures.

This shear can be converted into a fault density, which is measured with respect to the hypothetical f.c.t. structure. Experimental data of the fault densities from the 18R martensites in both Cu-Al (ψ = 1) and Cu-Zn-Al (ψ = 0.935) alloys are directly obtained by means of high resolution electron microscopy. On the other hand, the corresponding fault densities for both alloys are calculated in terms of the phenomenological theory of Wechsler-Lieberman-Read.

In this work the thermoelastic behaviour of a single-interface L21-to-18R transformation has been studied. It was found that the slope of curves of interface position against temperature varied from 0.05 to 0.004 K μm−1 depending on the thermal treatment to which the sample had been subjected. The smallest hysteresis width in a carefully polished material was found to be about 0.06 K. A simple model suggests that the thermoelasticity is ultimately related to the interaction of the martensite with pre-existent dislocations in the matrix.},

After the retransformation to the austenite on heating some nuclei are retained which are responsible for the formation of preferential martensite variants on cooling without a stress. In this paper it is attempted to contribute to the clarification of the nature of these nuclei in Cu–Zn–Al single crystals. In the single crystals with martensite start temperatures between 0 and 20°C the martensite was stress induced and aged at 60°C. Samples which were retransformed on heating were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Thin martensite plates were observed to remain even after the bulk had retransformed owing to a diffusion controlled lowering of their free energy and probably to pinning effects. They acted as nuclei which on cooling first expanded laterally and then thickened, their high density leading to a perfect TWME.},

It consists in the ability of the material to recover its original shape after being deformed through or in the martensitic phase. This shape recovery occurs because the same parent phase is obtained after the retransformation. However, it is shown in this work that, under very special circumstances, two differently oriented variants of the parent phase can be obtained from a martensite single variant. This breakdown of the shape-memory effect was found after transforming a single crystal into a unique plate of martensite by single interface growth. During the retransformation two variants of the parent phase appeared which were related to each other by the martensite symmetry operations (symmetry group C2h). The experimental results are consistent with those obtained by applying the Wechsler—Lieberman—Read (WLR) phenomenological theory.},

Samples with two different thermal treatments, air cooled and water quenched from 1070 K, were tested. The contribution of the nucleation processes to the hysteretic behaviour was evaluated. It was found that the intrinsic pseudoelasticity, due to the interaction of the martensite with the dislocations, plays a crucial role in the phenomenology of the transformation. This interaction prevents the growth of a unique plate and the transformation proceeds by successive nucleation of new plates. The friction associated to the movement of a single interface was also measured. From the experiments the relevant parameters which determine the hysteretic behaviour were identified. The hysteresis loops were computer simulated on the base of these parameters. The results showed a good agreement with the experimental observations. On effectue une étude détaillée des caractéristique des cycles d'hystérésis des transformations induites par la contrainte en utilisant un appareillage à haute résolution. Des échantillons ayant subi deux traitements thermiques différents, refroidis à l'air et trempés depuis 1070 K, sont testés. La contribution des mécanismes de germination à l'hystérésis est évaluée. On trouve que la pseudo-élasticité intrinsèque, due à l'interaction de la martensite avec les dislocations, joue un rôle crucial dans la phénoménologie de la transformation. Cette interaction empêche la croissance d'une plaquette unique et la transformation se produit par la germination successive de nouvelles plaquettes. Le frottement associé au mouvement d'une seule interface est mesuré aussi. A partir de ces expériences, les paramètres significatifs qui déterminent l'hystérésis sont identifiés. Les boucles d'hystérésis sont simulées sur ordinateur en se basant sur ces paramètres. Les résultats montrent un bon accord avec les observations expérimentales. Die Merkmale der Hystereseschleifen bei spannungsinduzierten Umwandlungen werden mit einem hochauflösenden Apparat ausführlich studiert. Proben mit zwei unterschiedlichen Wärmegeschichten, wasser- und luftabgeschreckt von 1070 K, werden untersucht. Der Beitrag der Keimbildungsprozesse zum Hystereseverhalten wird ausgewertet. Es ergibt sich, daβ die intrinsische Pseudoelastizität, herrührend von der Wechselwirkung des Martensits mit den Versetzungen, eine kritische Rolle in der Phänomenologie der Umwandlung spielt. Diese Wechselwirkung verhindert das Wachstum einer einheitlichen Platte, d.h die Umwandlung läuft über die aufeinanderfolgende Bildung von neuen Platten ab. Die mit der Bewegung einer einzelnen Grenzfläche zusammenhängende Reibung wird zusätzlich gemessen. Aus den Experimenten werden die für das Hystereseverhalten wichtigen Parameter abgeleitet. Die Hystereseschleifen werden anhand dieser Parameter mit dem Rechner simuliert. Die Ergebnisse stimmen mit den experimentellen Beobachtungen gut überein.},

  abstract = {Thermally- and stress-induced single-interface and single-variant martensitic transformation, in specimens containing a fine distribution of γ precipitates, was studied. The average precipitate size was 7 nm and the density 8 × 1021 prec./m3. The hysteresis width, considerably larger than the one observed for specimens without precipitates, decreases with the number of cycles, from an initial value of 7.2 K to an asymptotic value of about 1.5 K. A simple model shows that the interaction can be explained essentially by considering the deformation due to the shape change upon transformation of the matrix cavities enclosing the precipitates. The energy to create dislocations and to produce the subsequent plastic deformation of the martensite around the precipitates is of the same order of magnitude as the excess of free energy associated to the hysteresis. Nucleation of the β phase inside a martensite plate was observed with a nucleation energy of about 1.3 J/mol.},

  abstract = {Dislocations are observed in many shape memory alloys after thermal or stress cycling. The amount of dislocations (with Burgers vector bβ = a0〈010〉 and 〈1̄11〉 line direction in the β phase) increases with the number of cycles. The dislocations are accumulated in the sample and are incorporated in the corresponding growing phase. The relative energy of the dislocations when embedded in the parent phase or in one or another variant of martensite is evaluated in this work. The crystallographic changes of the dislocations provide a primary selection rule for those martensite variants in which the dislocations have the lowest energy. In order to proceed more quantitatively a full calculation of the dislocation energies has to be performed using the anisotropic theory. In this work these calculations have been made on the basis of measured elastic constants of the β and 2H phases of a Cu-Al-Ni alloy. It is found that a given dislocation could indeed have different energies depending whether it is embedded in the β phase or one or another oriented variant of martensite. In particular, those dislocations with Burgers vector lying on the basal plane of the 2H martensite show the lowest energy as compared to their self energy when embedded in other oriented variants (Burgers vector out of the basal plane) or in the β phase. On observe des dislocations dans de nombreux alliages à mémoire de forme soumis à des cycles thermiques ou à des cycles de contrainte. Le nombre de dislocations (de vecteur de Burgers bβ = a0 〈010〉 et de direction 〈111〉 dans la phase β) augmente avec le nombre de cycles. Les dislocations s'accumulent dans l'échantillon et sont incorporées dans la phase qui se développe. On évalue l'énergie relative des dislocations bloquées dans la phase mère ou installées dans l'une des variantes de la martensite. Les modifications cristallographiques des dislocations fournissent une règle de sélection primaire pour les variantes martensitiques dans lesquelles les dislocations ont l'énergie minimale. Si l'on désire des règles plus quantitatives, il est nécessaire d'effectuer un calcul complet de l'énergie des dislocations dans le cadre de la théorie anisotrope. Dans cette étude, nous avons réalisé ces calculus à partir des constantes élastiques mesurées des phases β et 2H d'un alliage Cu-Al-Ni. Une dislocation donnée pourrait en effet avoir des énergies différentes suivant qu'elle est placée dans la phase β ou dans l'une ou l'autre des variantes orientées de la martensite. En particulier, les dislocations dont le vecteur de Burgers est parallèle au plan de base de la martensite 2H présentent l'énergie la plus basse par rapport à leur énergie propre, lorsqu'elles sont placées dans d'autres variantes orientées (vecteur de Burgers hors du plan de base) on dans la phase β. In vielen Formgedächtnislegierungen werden Versetzungen nach thermischer oder mechanischer zyklischer Belastung beobachtet. Die Dichte der Versetzungen (Burgersvektor b̄β = a0 〈010〉 und Linienrichtung 〈111〉 in der β -Phase) nimmt mit der Zahl der Zyklen zu. Die Versetzungen häufen sich in der Probe an und werden in die entsprechenden wachsenden Phasen eingebaut. In dieser Arbeit werden die relativen Energien der in der Mutterphase oder in der einen oder anderen Martensitvariante eingebauten Versetzungen ermittelt. Die kristallografischen änderungen der Versetzungen liefern eine erste Auswahlregel für diejenigen Martensitvarianten, in denen die Versetzungen die niedrigste Energie haben. Für eine bessere Quantifizierung muβ eine vollständige Berechnung der Versetzungsenergien im Rahmen der anisotropen Elastizitätstheorie durchgeführt werden. Hier werden solche Rechnungen auf der Grundlage der gemessenen elastischen Konstanten der β- und der 2H-Phasen der Cu-Al-Ni-Legierung durchgeführt. Es ergibt sich, daβ eine gegebene Versetzung tatsächlich unterschiedliche Energien aufweisen kann, wenn sie in der β-Phase oder einer der orientierten Martensitvarianten liegt. Insbesondere haben die Versetzungen, deren Burgersvektor in der Basisebene des 2H-Martensits liegen, die niedrigste Energie im Vergleich zu ihrer Energie in den anderen orientierten Varianten (mit dem Burgersvektor dann aus der Basisebene herausschauend) oder in der β-Phase.},

  abstract = {The martensitic transformation in copper-based alloys is thermoelastic, that is, the transformation progresses following the undercooling below the equilibrium temperature. In addition, a hysteresis is observed because of irreversible processes taking place during the transformation–retransformation path. These phenomena depend on the complexity of the problem and the related metastable phases being time dependent. In this report the most complex situation (temperature induced and stress free) is characterized via calorimetric and acoustic-emission measurements. Reduction in complexity is thus necessary if intrinsic phenomena are to be separated and quantified. Special experimental equipment with appropriate resolution is briefly outlined. The single-interface β-18R transformation was chosen and then the complexity was increased progressively to characterize the intrinsic phenomena. Even in the single-interface transformation, an intrinsic thermoelasticity is found, which was ascribed to the interaction of growing martensite with the existing, dislocations. In addition, the narrowest hysteresis width was measured. Nucleation and single-interface friction are distinguished. Dislocations show a paradoxical behavior in the martensitic transformation. Classically there is a perturbative component, but in samples without dislocations, breakdown of shape memory can be observed. The following rise in complexity relates the behavior of several martensite plates of the same type. The shape of the hysteresis cycles in stress-induced transformations can be very well described and simulated by using the elementary parameters measured in single-interface experiments. The experimental analysis shows the metastability is relatively important: it was found that the diffusional processes are important near room temperature or above. Several time-dependent contributions to the Ms and hysteresis cycles are introduced. Time constants were measured and predictable rules were established. Avoiding a stochastic interpretation, suitable algorithms to compute the time behavior of the Ms or the hysteresis cycles and internal loops were developed. Since the defects play a decisive role on the martensitic transformation characteristics, the crystallographic and energetic changes of the dislocations when embedded in the parent or martensitic phases were analyzed quantitatively The interaction of the martensitic transformation with precipitates and the evolution of hysteresis width with cycling and precipitate size is studied. Finally, the two-shape memory effect is analyzed in terms of the interactions of the martensite with dislocations and other defects.},

In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening of the positron-electron annihilation radiation was used to provide information about the chemical environment surrounding vacancy-like defects. The results obtained for the silver-free alloy indicate that, immediately after quenching from the solution treatment temperature, vacancy v-Cu-Mg clusters are formed in the supersaturated solid solution. During the early stages of ageing these clusters become richer in Cu and Mg and laths of the S phase (Al{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$}CuMg) nucleate preferentially on dislocation lines. Continued ageing led to gradual precipitation of an equi-axed phase in the matrix between the S phase laths which is believed to be the cubic Z phase thought previously to form only if silver is present. For the silver-containing Al-Cu-Mg alloy, v-Cu-Mg-Ag aggregates also form immediately after quenching and the solute transport mechanisms are the same. However, precipitation of the S phase is suppressed during ageing and the silver addition promotes accelerated formation of a finer dispersion of smaller equi-axed Z phase precipitates. For both alloys, no evidence was found that the Z phase is preceded by any pre-precipitate or GP zones. Combination of coincidence Doppler broadening and microanalysis results revealed the Z phase to have a Mg:Cu ratio of 2 which indicates that it differs from the well known T phase (Al{$<$}inf{$>$}6{$<$}/inf{$>$}CuMg{$<$}inf{$>$}4{$<$}/inf{$>$}) which the equilibrium phase diagram indicates should form in Al-Cu-Mg alloys with high Mg:Cu ratios. Additional ageing experiments at 240 °C showed that neither the Z phase or T phase are formed in the ternary alloy, but only precipitates of the S phase, while in the quaternary alloy the S phase is strongly suppressed and mainly Z phase precipitates are formed.},

If these absorbers are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section as the result of neutron absorption, they consume during the reactor core life and so are called burnable. These elements can be distributed inside an oxide ceramic that is stable under irradiation and thus called inert. Cubic zirconium oxide is one of the preferred materials to be used as inert matrix. It is stable under irradiation, experiments very low swelling, and is isomorphic to uranium oxide. The cubic phase is stabilized by adding small amounts of dopants like Dy 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 . As both dysprosium and gadolinium have a high neutron cross section, they are good candidates to prepare burnable neutron absorbers. Pyrochlores, like Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 , allow the solid solution of a large quantity of elements besides being stable under irradiation. These characteristics make them also useful for safe storage of nuclear wastes. We present a preliminary study of the thermal analysis of different compositions in the systems Gd 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 and Dy 2 O 3 -TiO 2 , investigating the feasibility to obtain oxide ceramics useful for the nuclear industry.},

  abstract = {High-Mn steels attract attention because of their various technological properties. These are mainly mechanical and functional, such as the shape-memory effect, high damping capacity, high strength with simultaneous large ductility, the TRIP/TWIP (transformation- and twinning-induced plasticity) effect, low cycle fatigue and high work hardening capacity. All these phenomena are associated with the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)–hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) martensitic transformation which takes place in these alloys. During this phase transition defects are introduced, mainly due to the large volume change between austenite and martensite. Knowing this volume change is key to understanding the mechanical behavior of these metallic systems. In the present article, a full-pattern refinement method is presented. The proposed method uses data obtained by means of conventional X-ray diffraction from regular bulk samples and allows a high-precision calculation of the lattice parameters of both phases, f.c.c. and h.c.p., under conditions very different from randomly oriented (powder) materials. In this work, the method is used to study the effect of chemical composition on the volume change between the two structures. By applying empirical models, the results enabled the design and fabrication of Fe–Mn-based alloys with a small volume change, showing the potential of this new tool in the search for improved materials.}

Cr is one of the additional elements which improve the properties of these alloys. In the present work structural data are obtained for the FCC austenite, and both martensitic structures, HCP and BCC, for an extended composition range where the FCC-HCP transition takes place. Lattice parameters are determined by X-Ray diffraction measurements performed at room temperature. The volume change between the austenite and each martensitic structure plays a significant role on relevant properties for martensitic transformations, like the strain energy associated to the transition. The effect of Mn and Cr on lattice parameters and volume change between FCC and HCP is determined and modeling of the data is presented. This result allows estimating the strain energy associated to the phase change. By using this information, the strain energy contribution to the balance of energy for the HCP nucleation is discussed. The addition of Cr decreases the volume change between FCC and HCP for contents larger than 12 wt\% Cr which leads to a decrease of the strain energy. Both effects favor an increased shape memory effect associated to the FCC-HCP martensitic transition.},

The microstructural changes which take place in the bulk were studied by different techniques and a consistent description of the defects which are formed is presented. Dislocations and trapped martensite are retained in two-dimensional arrays parallel to the basal plane of the martensite (basal plane defects), and these defects are responsible for the strong temperature effect on the mechanical behaviour of the alloys. The dislocations form the bulk defects during the first cycling stage, and afterwards internal stresses are high enough to retain martensite which shows a 2H structure. Partial recovery takes place at temperatures close to room temperature, which supports the role that point defects play in the mechanical behaviour of these alloys},

The test temperatures varied from low temperatures (liquid nitrogen) to above room temperature. The microstructure evolution during cycling has been analyzed by optical and transmission electron microscopy. A description of defects formed after cycling both in the bulk and on the surface is presented. A transition in the type of formed defects is found corresponding to an increase in the test temperature. Dislocation tangles parallel to the basal plane of the martensite, with trapped martensite inside, give way to dislocation arrays parallel to the habit plane of the transformation, as the test temperature increases. A correlation between this transition behavior and the mechanical evolution was found and the mechanisms of generation of bulk and surface defects are discussed. A correlation between dislocation arrays parallel to the habit plane and intrusion-extrusion defects on the surface is also presented. Both type of defects appear at temperatures higher than 173 K. The effect of point defects introduced during cycling and their change in mobility with test temperature are considered. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In addition, new extrapolations to 0 at.\% Mn are performed, which are compared with other indirect information on the HCP phase of Fe at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Finally, by combining the present measurements on the HCP phase with those on the face-centred cubic (FCC) phase reported in the first paper of this series, a detailed analysis is made of the changes in the interatomic distances as well as the relative volume change associated with the FCCHCP martensitic transformation.

Two calorimeters, viz., a thermal analysis differential scanning and a Perkin-Elmer calorimeter were used to determine the heat effect associated with the ε → γ transformation, in alloys subjected to several cycles of transformation (γ → ε) and retransformation (ε → γ). The amount of transformed material for each alloy was determined by dilatometry, and the volume difference between the ε and γ structures was taken from a recent assessment of the lattice parameters. It is found that the amount of material transformed on cooling is strongly affected by the increase in the Mn content, and is at least partly due to the stabilizing effect upon the γ phase of the magnetic ordering reaction, and to the microstructural changes which are induced by the thermal cycling through the martensitic transformation. A key result of the work is that the enthalpy difference decreases monotonically with increasing Mn content. This decrease should be relevant in the thermodynamic modeling of the ε and γ phases. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Microstructure was determined using X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Results were compared to thermodynamic models. In the ternary alloys under study, the lattice parameter of the Cu-Ni solid solution was generally correlated to the amounts of nickel incorporated into the Cu lattice. However, longer milling times reduced that lattice parameter and facilitated Zr insertion into the solid solution. For example, after 5 h of milling time, microstructural analysis showed the formation of a solid solution with cubic structure in Cu-43Ni-7Zr. This pattern is consistent with the presence of a lattice parameter between that of Cu and Ni (α−phase); in contrast, the Cu-33Ni-7Zr alloy showed an α-phase and another similar to Zr. Results suggest that, as the amount of nickel increases, the ability to form an amorphous phase decreases. Additionally, experimental and thermodynamic data showed a solid-solution formation stage, followed by an amorphous phase formation stage that occurred as milling time and Zr content increased.},

After successive voltammetric cycles, NPs become cleaner, but some agglomeration and structural modification occur; these effects affect the electrochemical behavior of Pd/C in different ways, so we used CO as a probe to better understand the processes taking place. CO stripping shows that the general features of the multiple oxidation peaks change with the number of cycles. Possibly, CO and OH from different NPs react when the particles agglomerate, contributing to CO stripping changes. Finally, different active areas are found when the charges involved in CO oxidation and PdO reduction are compared. Such differences are rationalized in terms of a balance between the increase of sites which promote the oxidation of CO and the loss of area provoked by the growing of the particles.},

For ethanol, CO2is produced from CO in a direct pathway involving several electrons, while acetic acid is produced through a parallel pathway. Conversely, for glycerol CO2seems to be mainly produced through a sequential pathway involving carboxylic acids, each one involving few electrons. The results suggest that glycerol demands surfaces that speed up the oxidation of partially oxidized species formed at intermediate potentials. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Anodes and cathodes of fuel cells are usually composed of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on carbon, in order to increase their active area. Since the degradation of the catalyst affects the performance of the fuel cells, understanding the stability of its components is pivotal to make these systems more reliable. As such, graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes have been employed as alternative supports to improve the stability of anodes in fuel cells. In this context, we have used polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) combined with a one-step chemical reduction induced by ethylene glycol to synthesize Pd NPs dispersed on chemically converted graphene (CCG). We compared the electrochemical stability of Pd NPs supported on carbon black (C), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and CCG. MWCNTs and CCG make Pd NPs electrochemically more stable than carbon black. Pd/CCG catalysts are more stable than Pd/MWCNTs during the first potential cycles, while Pd/MWCNTs showed a higher long-term stability. These results allow us to consider a competition between agglomeration of NPs and degradation of the support, where the agglomeration seems to be limited by the available surface area of the support.},

  abstract = {The application of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) in mechanical engineering (ME) or in civil engineering (CE) requires the tuning of the physical properties with each particular need. When the target involves dampers for quakes in CE the number of full working cycles is relatively small (i.e. 200) but the application requires guaranteed behavior after several years of inactivity. On the contrary some devices in ME may need relatively high frequencies operating for a long period of time. In this work the mesoscopic effects in the SMA are quantified to ensure guaranteed behavior in the frame of dampers for CE applications. For instance, the actions of accumulated deformation in cycling and the changes induced by external temperature (i.e., summer-winter) are evaluated. Also, the perturbations induced by diffusive (induced by phase metastability, i.e. produced by microscopic interactions) are considered. In particular, the phase coexistence effects are visualized in Cu-based and partially in NiTi alloys. The practical creep induced by cycling and the coexistence actions are decisive in damping applications.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) on Ag(111) and Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical techniques, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results show that MBA molecules adsorb intact on the Ag (111) surface via a thiolate bond, arranged in a (√3 × 4) lattice with coverage θ = 0.25. The phase diagram built using DFT data shows that this lattice is more stable than the dense (√7 × √7)R19.1° MBA lattices on reconstructed Ag(111) surfaces. No significant amounts of sulfide were found neither on the Ag(111) surfaces nor on MBA-protected AgNPs, suggesting that the Ag core@Ag-sulfide shell structure where thiolates could be grafted cannot be applied to the MBA-protected AgNPs. Slow degradation of the MBA protective layer in ambient conditions on the AgNPs results in disulfide formation and AgNP sintering. ■ INTRODUCTION Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols on Au and Ag have attracted considerable attention in the past 25 years due to their multiple applications in nanoscience and nanotechnol-ogy. 1−5 Previous works have shown that thiols adsorb on Ag(111) as thiolates forming at saturation coverage a distorted (√7 × √7)R19.1° lattice with θ ≈ 0.44. The molecules adopt a standing-up configuration with a tilt angle between α ≈ 0− 19°. 6,7 On the other hand, experimental data from different techniques indicate that the strong thiol adsorption induces a reconstruction of the Ag(111) surface. 8 The first model, proposed for methanethiol (MT) on the reconstructed Ag(111) surface (R), involves a near-hexagonal surface layer with a Ag density that is only 3/7 of the underlying substrate layers and with the organic molecules adsorbed into 3-fold coordinated hollow sites. 9 This arrangement is also consistent with the observed (√7 × √7)R19.1° lattice (nearest-neighbor distance d = 0.44 nm) although the substrate has been strongly reconstructed by vacancies formation. Later, it was shown that this model does not imply a better thermodynamic stability since it has a similar surface free energy value (γ) to that estimated for the (√7 × √7)R19.1° MT lattice on the unreconstructed (U) surface. It is not surprising because the formation of 4/7 Ag vacancies implies a large energy cost.},

When the interparticle spacing reaches a critical value (order of magnitude: 200 nm), three distinct transformation processes are observed on cooling from the high-temperature phase using differential scanning calorimetry and in situ transmission electron microscopy. The transformation sequence begins with the formation of R-phase starting from all precipitate/matrix interfaces (first step). The transformation continues with the formation of B19′ and its subsequent growth along all precipitate/matrix interfaces (second step). Finally, the matrix in between the precipitates transforms to B19′ (third step).

Methane partial oxidation was studied over a Rh(1 wt.\%)@Al2O3catalyst, composed of Rh nanoparticles embedded in an Al2O3matrix, and the results were compared with those of a reference Rh(1 wt.\%)/Al2O3, obtained by incipient wetness impregnation procedure. The embedded catalyst was prepared by precipitation of Al(OH)3in the presence of stabilised Rh nanoparticles, followed by calcination. H2chemisorption data confirm the accessibility of most of the protected Rh nanoparticles. Both Rh catalysts are active for MPO, reaching complete CH4conversion above 1023 K. Notably, the embedded catalyst is more resistant to deactivation during consecutive run-up and steady state catalytic experiments. The protection offered by the surrounding layer of porous oxide prevents extensive sintering of the active metal phase, even after high temperature aging, as observed by high resolution TEM. Moreover, with respect to the standard impregnated sample, the embedded Rh(1 wt.\%)@Al2O3is more resistant towards the undesirable incorporation of Rh into the alumina under oxidising conditions. At 1023 K, stable MPO activity is observed for at least 60 h, after which slow deactivation starts, essentially by coke deposition. Treatment with O2restores the catalytic activity, while brief switches to O2during reaction prevent deactivation. Increasing the working temperature or the reactant concentration significantly reduces the effects of coke deactivation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We report the recrystallization of metastable hexagonal and body centered cubic BCC phase in free-standing 6 μm thick Cu-Al-Ni films grown by DC sputtering at room temperature. The results show that the BCC phase recrystallizes to L21 at around 533 K together with precipitation of γ2-phase. Annealing temperatures (533 K–623 K) at short times (0–30 min) produce systematic increment of the fraction of γ2-phase. Films with phase coexistence of hexagonal, γ2 and L21 structure display temperature driven martensitic transformation. This transformation is observed for samples with austenite grain size of around 30 nm. In all cases, the martensitic transformation temperature (MS) notoriously decreases (compared to bulk) and systematically increases with the annealing temperatures and annealing time. In addition, the films display extended transformation and retransformation ranges along with asymmetric hysteresis, which may be associated to restitutive forces due to elastic deformations at martensite – martensite and martensite – austenite interfaces. Annealing temperatures above 623 K produce fast precipitation to equilibrium α- and γ2-phases. The austenitic phase can be recovered after annealing over 1000 K and fast quenching in ice-water.},

However, each model independently can not describe all experimental data. In this paper is presented experimental data of logarithmic decrement associated to dislocation lines, measured in Hz and MHz ranges, on high purity copper single crystals plastically deformed by compression and torsion at room temperature. The experimental data obtained for the Bordoni Peak, analyzed on the basis of the kink model, shows the predicted temperature dependence of the effective enthalpy, a evidence of the kink diffusion mechanism. The data can be well fitted over all temperature range investigated, assuming the contribution of kink relaxation and kink resonance aging simultaneously. From the last mechanism a temperature dependent kink density is assumed. This procedure allows to explain the width and the asymmetry of the Bordoni peak.},

  abstract = {The compression creep behaviour of Al-SiCfibermetal matrix composites (MMC), made by hot-pressing (HP), was evaluated at various temperatures and over several orders of magnitude of strain rates. The interpretation of metal flow-patterns during the whole deformation cycle was complex owing to the fact that the short-fibre distribution in the composites was roughly planar. However, every specimen showed a well-defined flow stress or plateau (σtruep) up to the end of the tests that were associated with nearly 50\% linear compression strains. Such stresses clearly increased with the volume fraction (f) of fibres and strain rates, and decreased with increasing temperatures. Cross-examination of the creep curves [log strain rate (γ̇) versus log shear stress (τ)] for both the HP Al matrix and composites show an apparent stress exponent nap= [δ (ln γ ̇)/δ (ln τ)] clearly increasing while decreasing τ. This anomalous behaviour can be attributed to the existence of a finite threshold stress (τ0) for every composition. This threshold stress appears to be related to the oxide contamination (judged from TEM observations) of the matrix, as a result of the use of powder metallurgy (PM) synthesis method. Following certain approximations during deformation behaviour of PM specimens reinforced with ceramic particles, the present data, for short-fibre reinforced MMC, seems to be consistent with the mechanism of dislocation climb that is characterized by an stress exponent of around five, and an activation energy close to that for self-diffusion in pure aluminum (143.2 kJ mol-1). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

MPa in an axial die to study their compacting behavior. The final relative densities D were higher than 0.95 for all unreinforced powders and 0.86 for the composite.

Kawakita equation results as a best linear fit for all tests, but its compressibility parameter b is not in agreement with the hardening behavior of the composite. Panelli and Ambrosio equation could describe the data fairly well qualitatively for all compactions tests, however, over a limited pressure range. Finally, Konopicky relationship turned out to be very useful and fitted the densification data of all three materials quite well. Its slope from linear P vs. ln (1/(1 - D)) plots, is related to the yield stress and characterizes the work hardening developed during plastic deformation while the density was increased.

For that purpose, an instrumented experimental setup allowing determining the specimens top or bottom displacement together with the machine cross head displacement was designed. The effects of the machine and load train compliances on the respective displacements values were carefully evaluated. The significance of the different displacements definitions was demonstrated by proposing two alternative procedures for assessing the specimen thickness evolution and by revising the definition of the load associated with the determination of the material yield stress from SPT. To facilitate the systematic study of the influence of the different parameters that might be affecting the test, a finite element (FEM) analysis tool was developed. The results obtained from FEM simulations show that even using a constitutive model that does not include damage initiation it is possible to adequately reproduce the SPT load vs. displacement response curve to near maximum load and also the diametral profiles of the deformed specimens. The FEM analysis indicate the arbitrary character of the different proposals for determination of the load for yield stress estimation with them corresponding to different degrees of plastic deformation of the specimen.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the effect of pre-ageing between 293 K and 373 K in a 6082 Aluminum alloy using mainly differential scanning calorimetry in combination with Vickers hardness and transmission electron microscopy. The pre-ageing effects are characterized through the modifications of the β″ precipitation DSC signal. Pre-ageing at 293 K leads to a progressive increase of the peak temperature, until it reaches a plateau at long aging times (≥250min), while pre-ageing at 373 K leads to a continuous decrease of the peak temperature. The results indicate the formation of two different types of clusters, named 1 and 2, below and above a pre-ageing transition temperature, determined to be around 343 K. After pre-ageing below 343 K, the dissolution of clusters 1 superimposed with the β″ precipitation occurs, and the enthalpy change remains almost independent of pre-ageing time. Instead, pre-ageing above 343 K leads to the formation of type 2 clusters that transform on heating into β″ phase precipitates, with a decreasing enthalpy change as pre-ageing time increases. This result indicates that clusters 2 evolve during pre-ageing, reaching a structure/composition with formation enthalpy similar to that of β″ phase. Vickers hardness reveals the different evolution of both types of clusters with aging time. Transmission electron microscopy observations on samples subsequently aged at 453 K, show that type 2 clusters favour the nucleation of β″ precipitates, while type 1 clusters hamper such nucleation process.},

  abstract = {As cast Cu90Co10 ribbons rapidly solidified by twin-roller melt spinning, exhibit special microstructure features. This processing method provides scenarios where a different phase selection takes place; coherent Co precipitates form directly from solidification, with neither a spinodal-like composition oscillation nor a discontinuously precipitated laminar phase. Samples are processed at tangential wheel speeds of 10 m/s (V10), 15 m/s (V15), 20 m/s (V20) and 30 m/s (V30). Microstructures resulting from this single step process are characterized and the hysteresis properties and the magnetoresistance effects evaluated. Samples V30 have a quite uniform density of coherent precipitates, with a narrow size distribution around 4 nm. On contrary, non-uniform precipitate distributions are found in samples cooled at lower rates; zones with a high density of coherent Co-rich precipitates are found forming colonies. These colonies are consistent with the extended compositional fluctuations occurring during very early stages in the cooling process. Samples may exhibit wide (V10) and even bimodal (V15) size distributions. Only samples V30 behave close to the ideal superparamagnetism. Samples V20 present relatively large coercivity and relative remanence and behave as an interacting superparamagnet, while the hysteresis loops of ribbons cooled at lower rates exhibit a ferromagnetic contribution in addition to the superparamagnetic-like one. This ferromagnetic component arises from blocked precipitates, larger than the upper bound size for superparamagnetic behavior at 300 K (12 nm). Room temperature magnetoresistance values associated to granular scattering units decrease as the mean precipitate size increases, but they remain below 2\%, which is lower than that measured in samples annealed after rapid solidification, indicating that in this latter case contributions from the spinodally segregated matrix take place in addition to that of Co granules.},

Moreover, pseudoelasticity is only observed within a limited temperature window. In our case, optimum initial pseudoelasticity was obtained in a region of 10-80 °C. While all this is well appreciated, the fact that the evolution of the pseudoelastic behavior shows a strong temperature dependence even within this 'pseudoelastic window' has received much less attention.

The higher Tg-TSOFTvalues were obtained for glasses AR6 (main components: 57.3\%P2O5. 18.4\%Fe2O3. 18.9\%UO2.67) and AR7 (mc: 65\%P2O5, 19\%Fe2O3, 9.5\%UO2.67) and were the most stable glasses against crystallization. The lowest thermal expansion α was measured for AR1 (mc: 54\%P2O5, 27\%Fe2O3, 13.5\%UO2.67). AR7 was the least chemically durable composition, whereas the most durable glasses were those containing the highest percentages of UO2.67(AR6, AR1 and AR5). The least stable glasses against crystallization were AR4 (mc: 45.8\% P2O5, 42.2\%Fe2O3, 6.4\%UO2.67), AR5 (mc: 46.2\%P2O5. 35.4\%Fe2O3. 13.0\%UO2.67) and AR2 (mc: 54.2\% P2O5, 33.1\%Fe2O3, 6.4\%UO2.67); their DTA crystallization (Tc) peaks were met at 560 °C (AR4), 600 °C (AR5) and 620 °C (AR2). For these glasses Tc increased with UO2.67increasing. The highest internal crystallizations were met for AR2 and AR5. Dendritic crystal growth mode was detected for slowly heat treated (up to 650 °C) AR5 glass. The dendrite arms were clearly seen by SEM and the EBSD (electron back scattered diffraction) patterns (fitted to phase FePO4) remained unaltered upon moving slightly the detection position throughout those arms. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study was performed using the Joule effect and pseudoelastic martensitic transformations in single crystals of Cu-Zn-Al alloys. The analysis of the system establishes that: the sensitivity of calorimetric measurements after a filter of two poles and two zeros is 166 mV W-1 (at 297 K), the noise is near 1.5 μV and the drift is close to 30 μV in 6 h. The reproducibility of the sensitivity working with one sample is better than ±0.3\%, and the change to a new sample keeps the value below ±0.5\%. The uncertainty in reproducibility in the martensitic transformation (including repositioning) does not overcome ±1.6\%. The used calorimetric sensors limit the temperature to 373 K. The furnace control originated fluctuations on the base line (near ±20 μV), which by means of an auxiliary signal processing were reduced to 50\% (less than ±10 μV).},

  abstract = {Ball milling experiments performed in the last decade in various systems opened the question about the stability of crystalline nanoparticles with respect to the same group of atoms but in the amorphous state. The general purpose of the present work is to develop a predictive approach to this problem, and assess its accuracy by confronting thermodynamic calculations with experimental observations on Cu-Zn nanoparticles. The bases of the approach are as follows. First, the present Gibbs energy formalism makes use of the “lattice-stability” concept currently applied in so-called CALPHAD (“Calculation of Phase Diagrams”) modeling work. Second, the enthalpy of formation of the alloy phases is treated in the framework of the Miedema model, with special attention to the parameters for the amorphous phase. Third, the surface contribution to Gibbs energy is accounted for. With the current thermodynamic description, the sizes of the crystalline nanoparticles which are stable with respect to the amorphous are determined by calculation. These predictions are confronted with the minimum size of the nanoparticles generated by subjecting γ-Cu-Zn powders to low-energy milling treatments, which is determined by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. On this basis, a discussion is reported of the accuracy of the present approach. In particular, the parameters in the Gibbs energy description which crucially affect the agreement between calculations and experiments are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The theme of the present work is the procedure for evaluating the minimum size for the stability of a crystalline particle with respect to the same group of atoms but in the amorphous state. A key goal of the study is the critical analysis of an extensively quoted paper by F.G. Shi [J. Mater. Res. 9 (1994) 1307–1313], who presented a criterion for evaluating a “crystallinity distance” (h) through its relation with the “critical diameter” (dC) of a particle, i.e., the diameter below which no particles with the crystalline structure are expected to exist at finite temperatures. Key assumptions of Shi's model are a direct proportionality relation between h and dC, and a prescription for estimating h from crystallographic information. In the present work the accuracy of the Shi model is assessed with particular reference to nanoparticles of the elements. To this end, an alternative way to obtain h, that better realizes Shi's idea of this quantity as “the height of a monolayer of atoms on the bulk crystal surface”, is explored. Moreover, a thermodynamic calculation of dC, which involves a description of the bulk- and the surface contributions to the crystalline/amorphous relative phase stability for nanoparticles, is performed. It is shown that the Shi equation does not account for the key features of the h vs. dC relation established in the current work. Consequently, it is concluded that the parameter h obtained only from information about the structure of the crystalline phase, does not provide an accurate route to estimate the quantity dC. In fact, a key result of the current study is that dC crucially depends on the relation between bulk- and surface contributions to the crystalline/amorphous relative thermodynamic stability.},

The evolution of the stress-strain curves with time was followed in partially transformed specimens, having several martensite plates, all of the same variant. Exponential type behaviour was observed, and four different time constants were obtained from experiments performed under particular conditions. A physical interpretation could be suggested for all of these parameters. They are related to the evolution of the Ms with the time elapsed from the thermal treatment, the martensite stabilization and the β-recovery. Some of these time constants were found to be dependent on the presence and movement of the β-martensite interfaces. A model based on the experimentally determined parameters was developed, which allows to simulate the observed time-dependent behaviour.},

It is argued that an earlier structural model proposed by Delaey and Warlimont to account for similar reflections is inadequate. Instead, it is proposed that the reflections could appear by double diffraction via Higher Order Laue Zone reflections without requiring any changes in the M18R structure for the martensite. Nous avons étudié les diagrammes de diffraction électronique de la zone [100], obtenus dans la martensite CuZnAlβ′1. Des réflexions interdites par le facteur de structure apparaissent dans ces diagrammes. Nous démontrons qu'un modèle structural antérieur, proposé par Delaey et Warlimont pour expliquer des réflexions semblables, n'est pas correct. A la place, nous suggérons que ces réflexions pourraient apparaître par une double diffraction faisant intervenir des réflexions de zones de Laue d'ordre supérieur, sans qu'il soit besoin d'invoquer des modifications de la structure M18R de la martensite. Die Elektronenbeugungsdiagramme der [100]-Zone wurden in β′1-M18R CuZnAl untersucht. In diesen Diagrammen erscheinen Reflexe, die nach dem Strukturfaktor verboten sind. Es wird dargelegt, daß ein früher von Delaey und Warlimont zur Erklärung ähnlicher Reflexe vorgeschlagenes Modell nicht anwendbar ist. Stattdessen wird hier vorgeschlagen, daß die Reflexe als Folge von Doppelbegung über Reflexe aus Lauezonen höherer Ordnung auftreten könnten. Dieser Vorschlag hat den Vorteil, daß die M18R-Struktur des Martensits unverändert bleiben kann.},

Measurements of the electrical resistance as a function of temperature at different constant mechanical loads accompanied by complementary experiments with variable loads at constant temperature were performed. Results show that the transformation mechanisms in UFG microstructures exhibit a higher level of complexity when compared with those characterizing the behavior of other microstructures (e.g., recrystallized or larger grains size). It was found that a threshold stress level below 150 MPa delimits the transition from a homogeneous (low stress) to localized but reversible Lüders type transformation (high stress) when the transformations are induced under constant applied stress and that reorientation processes require stresses of 100 MPa in the present UFG wires. Even though the strain evolutions do not always show two distinct yielding events during cooling or heating, electrical resistance measurements proved that a two-step transformation involving R-phase and B19′ martensite was always present in the extended range of temperatures and stresses investigated here.},

  abstract = {Martensitic phase transformations were studied in ultrafine grained Ni-rich pseudoelastic NiTi wires during cyclic deformation under small imposed strain amplitudes. Small strain variation tests were complemented by a thermographic analysis of the emerging temperature distributions in the specimens. The characteristics of the observed thermal profiles result from the specific phase transitions which take place at different stress levels. Homogeneous temperature changes, corresponding to a non-localized transformation activity along the specimen length, were observed throughout the whole range of applied stresses, starting from values as low as 100 MPa. This behavior is in line with previous literature reports for the stress-induced transformation from B2 austenite to R-phase as long as the critical stress for B19′ martensite formation is not reached. In the present study, similar type of transformation activity could also be demonstrated at higher strains/stresses, even after the stress induced transformation to B19′ was apparently completed. These findings suggest that transformation activity involving the B2 phase is present throughout the whole pseudoelastic stress-strain cycle; i.e., it is not restricted to the initial loading portion. Finally, non-localized transformation to or from B19′ was identified during small amplitude strain variations in the plateau-like coexistence ranges of the pseudoelastic cycle.},

  abstract = {Internal friction (IF) and modulus measurements have been carried out on a composite material taken from the negative electrode of a commercial Ni-metal-hydride (Ni-MH) battery, both in the as-received condition and after in situ gaseous hydrogen exposure, using a sub-resonant torsion pendulum at fixed frequencies between 0.1 and 10 Hz in the temperature range 90-450 K. In both cases the IF spectrum is composed by two peaks: P1 at 190 K and P2 at 290 K, with corresponding modulus variations. The P1 data are detected to be due to a thermally activated process which frequency shift activation energy is (0.175±0.004) eV and fitted to a relaxation peak with a larger wide respect to a Debye peak, being β equal to 2.2. It is interpreted to be due to the movement of misfit dislocations within the AB5intermetallic-type alloy particles in the presence of nearby H atoms, acting as a Cottrell atmosphere. Peak P2 is ascribed to the decomposition and formation of hydride phase in the alloy particles upon heating and cooling, respectively. The peak heights are shown to increase in the hydrided samples, supporting the above interpretation. These results are also discussed in connection with previous measurements on an electrode material prepared at the laboratory. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thermal treatment removes organics from the Au NPs and leads to larger nanoparticles and the formation of networks, dimmers, and nanoplates of various shapes (circles, hexagons, and triangles). Raman and HRTEM revealed bilayer graphene and Moiré patterns as determined by the 2D band and dislocated atomic layers, respectively. TERS performed on the heterojunction exhibits a reversible increase in frequency and sharpening of the characteristic bands in graphene along with the exaltation of bands such as D + D′. A close examination into a single triangular-shape nanoplate reveals that the most irregular area of the nanoplate is consistent with the higher Raman enhancement of Rh6G when compared to other areas of the same feature. This work may shed light onto new ways of transferring graphene, fundamental aspects concerning local strains in the heterojunction, and SERS on a single Au nanostructure.}

Measuring the resolved shear stress required to induced the transformation in alloys with sufficiently low TL21 ordering temperature shows that it is possible to supperss the B2-L21 ordering transition by a rapid quench from temperatures Tq above but close to TL21. An analysis of the experimental results in terms of a simple model shows that the contribution of the L21 structure on the Ms temperature behaves linearly with (2xCu - 1)2 for the alloys considered. Finally we propose an emperical expression giving the Ms temperature of CuZnAl alloys as a function of composition. The expression is an extension of one proposed recently for CuZn binary alloys. We show that for ternary alloys with only B2 ordering. 1 at.\% A1 has the effect of (96/64) at.\% of Zn, while this effect reduces to (90.64) at.\% when the alloy develops the L21 superlattice.

La mesure de la tension nécessaire pour induire la transformation martensitique dans le cas d'alliages avec une température d'ordre TL21 suffisament basse, permet de montrer qu'il est possible de supprimer la transition B2-L21 par tempre rapide depuis des températures Tq supérieures mais proches à Tq. L'analyse des résultats expérimentaux à partir d'un modéle simple permet de montrer que la contribution de la structure L21 sur la température Ms présente, pour les alliages considérés, une dépendence linéare avec (2xCu - 1)2. Finallement nous proposons une expression empirique donnant la température Ms d'alliages CuZnAl en fonction de la composition. Cette expression est obtenue comme une extension de celle qui a étée proposée récemment pour lálliage binaire CuZn. Nous montrons que pour l'alliage ternaire avec seulement ordre type B2, 1 at.\% d'aluminium a l'effet de (96/64) at.\% de Zn, tandis que cet effet est réduit à (90/64) at.\% quand le systéme developpe la structure L21. Wir untersuchen den Beitrag der ferngeordenetn L21-Struktur auf die Ms-Temperatur der CuZnAl-Legierungen. Messungen der für die Einleitung der Umwandlung nötigen Scherspannung an Legierungen mit genügend niedriger TL21-Ordnungseinstellungstemperatur zeigen, daβ es möglich ist, die Ordnungseinsstellung B2-L21 mit schnellen Abschrecken von Temperaturen Tq oberhalb von, aber nahe an TL21 zu unterdrüchen. Die Analyse der experimentellen Ergenbnisse mit einem einfachen Modell zeigt, daβ der Beitrag der L21-Struktur zur Ms-Temperatur bei den betrachteten Legierungen linear mit (2xCu - 1)2 verläuft. Zum Schluβ schlagen wir einen empirischen Ausdruck von, der Ms-Temperatur in Abhängigkeit von der Zusammensetzung der CuZnAl-Legeirungen deschreibt. Dieser Ausdruck ist eine Erweiterung eines kürzlich für binäre CuZn Legierungen vorgeschlagene Ausdrucks. Wir zeigen, daβ bei ternären Legierungen mit nur der B2-Ordnung 1 At.-\% A1 den Einfluβ von (96/64) At.\% Zn hat, wohingegen dieser Einfluβ sich auf (90/64) At.-\% verringert, wenn die Legierung das L21-Übergitter entwickelt.}

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The arrangements of dislocations formed during thermally-induced martensitic transformation cycling in a CuZnAl single crystal have been analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The dislocations were mainly of a mixed type, with bdu = {$<$}111{$>$}andb = {$<$}001{$>$}. Two thermal treatments prior to cycling have been considered, finding some differences in the dislocatios distributions and their evolution. These differences are well correlated with those found when studying the thermal cycling of the same alloy by means of calorimetry. Simple considerations show that the evolution of the macroscopic parameters (transformation temperatures, hysteresis cycle shape and position) can be explained semiquantitatively in terms of the free energy changes produced by: (a) the dislocations, when embedded in the ß or in the martensitic phases; (b) stacking faults created in martensite by some of the dislocations appearing during the cycling and (c) the increase in the area of martensite-martensite interfaces. On a analysé, par microscopie électronique à transmission, les distributions de dislocations formées dans un alliage CuZnAl monocristallin, pendant la répétition cyclique de la transformation martensitique induite par température. Les dislocations formées sont de type mixte, avec u = {$<$}111{$>$}et b = {$<$}001{$>$}. On a consideré deux traitements thermiques des échantillons avant le cyclage thermique, et quelques différences dans les distributions de dislocations et leur évolution ont été observées. Ces différences sont bien correlées avec celles montrées par l'étude calorimétrique du cyclage thermique sur le même alliage. Quelques considerations simples montrent que l'évolution des paramètres macroscopiques (températures de transformation, forme et position du cycle d'hystérésis) peut être expliquée semi-quantitativement si l'on tient en compte des changements dans l'énergie libre produits par: (a) les dislocations, quand elles sont dans la phase mère ß ou dans la phase martensitique; (b) lesdéfauts d'empilement créés en martensite par certaines dislocations qui apparaissent pendant le cyclage, et (c) la croissance du nombre d'interfaces martensite-martensite. Die Versetzungsanordnung, die sich während der zyklisch thermische induzierten martensitischen Umwandlung in einem CuZnAlEinkristall bildet, wird im Durchstrahlungselektronenmikroskop analysiert. Die Versetzungen sind meist vom gemischten Typ mit u = {$<$}111{$>$}und b = {$<$}001{$>$}. Zwei thermische Behandlungen vor den Temperaturwechseln werden verwendet, um Unterschiede in der Versetzungsverteilung und deren Entwicklung aufzufinden. Diese Unterschiede sind gut korreliert mit denjenigen, die kalorimetrisch bei der Untersuchung des Temperaturzyklens dderselben Legierung gefunden wurden. Einfache Argumente zeigen, daß die Entwicklung der makroskopischen Parameter (Umwandlungstemperatur, Form und Lage der Hystereseschleife) halbquantitativ erklärt werden kann anhand von Änderungen der freien Energie. Diese rühren her von (a) den Versetzungen, wenn sie in der ß-oder in der martensitischen Phase liegen, (b) den Stapelfehlern, die im Martensit von einigen während der Zyklens erscheinenden Versetzungen erzeugt werden und (c) der Zunahme der Fläche der Martensit-Martensit-Grenzen.},

  abstract = {Stoichiometric Ni2MnGa alloys are processed by two rapid solidification techniques – single-roller (SR) and twin-roller (TR) melt spinning – and the resulting microstructures and magnetic properties determined. Samples processed at tangential wheel speeds of 10 m/s (V10) and 15 m/s (V15) are studied in the as-cast condition to analyze the influence of the production methods on the microstructure. Important aspects like the resulting phases, their crystallographic texture, magnetic properties, martensitic transformation temperatures and Curie temperatures are compared. In addition, the magnetization mechanism involving twin boundary motion is explored. Our results indicate that the TR method provides lower cooling rates, thicker samples, higher internal stresses and larger MnS precipitates. However, the quenching rate is mainly determined by the tangential wheel velocity. TR samples also exhibit [100] texture normal to the ribbon plane but in a lesser extent than SR ribbons. Martensitic transformation temperatures are higher in samples V15 (\textasciitilde{} 150 K) than in V10 (\textasciitilde{} 100 K), with no clear difference between the SR and TR modes. This behavior is explained by considering distinct degrees of disorder in the L21 austenite phase resulting from quenching. The hysteresis of the transformation, defined as the difference Af − MS, takes similar values in the four samples analyzed. Pre-martensitic transformation temperatures are also slightly higher in samples V15, (230 ± 3) K, than in samples V10, (222 ± 3) K, as the magnitude of the Hopkinson effect, in good agreement with a higher residual stress level in TR ribbons. In the martensitic state, all ribbons exhibit hysteresis loops characteristic of a magnetization mechanism involving twin boundary motion. The switching magnetic fields for the onset of Type I twin boundary motion result between 220 mT and 365 mT, values equivalent to twinning stresses of about 1 MPa. It is concluded that both procedures, SR and TR melt spinning, provide microstructures favoring magnetic field induced twin variant reorientation.},

The resulting microstructures were previously characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and by transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM). EDS results indicated that all the alloys have the composition Ni2MnGa; at room temperature and above this temperature, a cubic L2(1) ferromagnetic ordered austenitic phase is observed. The Curie temperatures and the magnitude of the Hopkinson effect are estimated from the magnetic polarization versus temperature curves measured in a Faraday balance, in the range 300 K-400 K. As expected for samples with identical composition, the Curie temperatures remain insensitive to the processing route. At low fields (10 mT), the magnitude of the Hopkinson effect is larger in samples quenched at lower rates and it practically vanishes in all the alloys for applied fields near 100 mT.},

At room temperature, the major phase in the as-cast alloys is the cubic L21Ni2MnGa ordered austenitic phase, with a lattice parameter only ∼0.1\% larger than the tabulated value. The order domain size in the austenitic phase decreases from (40±1) nm in samples V10 to (19±1) nm in V20. Mn(S,Se) small precipitates are also found uniformly embedded in the ribbons with mean size of (26±2) nm (V10) and (7±2) nm (V20), exhibiting a definite orientation relation with the austenitic matrix, {$<$}1 0 0{$>$}P// {$<$}1 0 0{$>$}a. The as-cast alloys transform to an intermediate cubic phase I at about 220-230 K depending on the quenching rate and to a martensitic phase at about 130 K. The high temperature austenitic phase and the low temperature martensitic phase are ferromagnetic; in both cases the saturation polarization is lower in samples quenched at higher rates. The demagnetization curves measured from saturation in the martensitic state show two marked steps: a first one for positive fields in V15 and V10 (∼46 mT) and a larger second one for relatively large inverse fields (∼130-250 mT) in all the samples. These steps are likely to arise from a demagnetization mechanism involving a field induced twin boundary motion in the few martensite variants selected by the crystallographic texture and the quenched stresses in the ribbons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), room temperature vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and SQUID measurements are employed for structural, morphological and magnetic sample characterization. For all the concentrations analyzed, the powder nanocomposites actually consist of spinel NiZn ferrite nanoparticles, dispersed in an amorphous silica matrix. TEM studies reveal different particle size distributions and particle morphologies for the three ferrite contents. The 20 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples consist of nearly spherical nanoparticles, of about 8 nm, mainly superparamagnetic, well-dispersed in the amorphous silica matrix, while the 5 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples exhibit a bimodal particle size distribution (5 and 30 nm) of single-domain nanoparticles embedded in the silica. In the 50 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples, two particle families are observed: small round superparamagnetic nanoparticles of about 8 nm embedded in the amorphous silica matrix and large, non-spherical, ferrimagnetic ones, forming agglomerates outside the matrix. In all the synthesized samples, thickness fringes are observed inside some of the ferrite nanoparticles in dark field images. This contrast is explained using the theory of electron diffraction in a weak beam dark field (WBDF) condition and considering spherical ferrite nanoparticles. A large range of tailored magnetic properties varying the fraction, dispersion and mean size of the ferrimagnetic NiZn ferrite particles is obtained. Room temperature saturation magnetization values are found in the range 3.0-30.4 Am2/kg for the different concentration samples. Coercivity values, between 1.9 and 7.6 mT, are more than 50\% higher than those measured in powders of pure stoichiometric NiZn ferrite nanoparticles and somewhat higher than those reported for similar NiZn ferrite/SiO2nanocomposites also synthesized by sol-gel processes.

  abstract = {The magnetization of Cu–Mn–Al alloys with a shape memory effect in the composition line Cu3 Al–Cu3Mn2 was measured from 5 K to room temperature and at fixed temperatures up to (5×107)/(4×π) A/m magnetic fields. It was found that from room temperature to about 90 K (depending upon composition) the samples behaved as superparamagnets[1]. This behavior is described in terms of the magnetic cluster size, the cluster concentration and the interaction between clusters for different compositions and temperatures by fitting the results with the Brillouin function proposed by Beck[2]. Evidence was also found that below this temperature, mictomagnetism (a mixture of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism) is present in these alloys. Careful measurement of the magnetization during the martensitic transformation, for a sample with 11.9 at.\% Mn was done, in order to estimate the magnetic energy change between β and martensite phases. No noticeable effect on the Ms martensitic transformation temperature, for applied magnetic fields up to (5×107)/(4×π) A/m, was found.},

  abstract = {Mg-10 mol\% LiBH4composite plus small amounts of FeF3is investigated in the present work. The presence of LiBH4during the milling process noticeably modifies the size and morphology of the Mg agglomerates, leading to faster hydrogenation and reaching almost the theoretical hydrogen capacity owing to enhanced hydrogen diffusion mechanism. However, the dehydrogenation of the system at low temperatures (≤300°C) is still slow. Thus, FeF;bsubesub \& addition is proposed to improve the dehydrogenation kinetic behavior. From experimental results, it is found that the presence of FeF;bsubesub \& results in an additional size reduction of the Mg agglomerates between ∼10 and ∼100 μm and the formation of stable phases such as MgF;bsubesub\&, LiF and FeB. The FeB species might have a catalytic effect upon the MgH;bsubesub\& decomposition. As a further result of the FeF;bsubesub\& addition, the Mg-10 mol\%LiBH;bsubesub\&-5 mol\% FeF;bsubesub\& material shows improved dehydrogenation properties: reduced dehydrogenation activation energy, faster hydrogen desorption rate and reversible hydrogen capacities of about 5 wt\% at 275°C. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The size distribution of particles, which is essential for many properties of nanomaterials, is equally important for the mechanical behaviour of the class of alloys whose strength derives from a dispersion of nanoscale precipitates. However, particle size distributions formed by solid-state precipitation are generally not well controlled. Here we demonstrate, through the example of core-shell precipitates in Al-Sc-Li alloys, an approach to forming highly monodisperse particle size distributions by simple solid-state reactions. The approach involves the use of a two-step heat treatment, whereby the core formed at high temperature provides a template for growth of the shell at lower temperature. If the core is allowed to grow to a sufficient size, the shell develops in a 'size focusing' regime, where smaller particles grow faster than larger ones. These results suggest strategies for manipulating precipitate size distributions in similar systems through simple variations in thermal treatments.},

Using these results we constructed a structure-zone map of the area adjacent to the grain boundary, which relates the reduced elastic modulus and nanoindentation hardness of the alloy to its graded microstructure. Our analysis indicates that the lowest hardness was found in the region where no precipitates are present at all, regardless of solute concentration. In regions where precipitation is different from that of the bulk, somewhat inferior mechanical properties are achieved.},

Motivated by the high solubility of In in (mC44) η′-Cu6Sn5compound as well as the occurrence of an In-doped η′-intermetallic in the microstructure of Cu/In-Sn/Cu solder joints, a theoretical study has been carried out to investigate the various physical effects of incorporating In at Sn Wyckoff sites of the binary η′-phase. Systematic ab~initio calculations using the projected augmented wave method and Vienna Ab~initio Simulation Package were used to determine the composition dependence of the structural and cohesive properties of η′-Cu6(Sn,In)5compounds, compared with those expected from the binary end-member compounds Cu6Sn5and Cu6In5. The molar volume shows significant deviations from Vegard’s law. The predicted composition dependence of the cohesive properties is discussed using two complementary approaches, viz. a valence-electron density approach as well as a bond-number approach, both accounting for the roughly linear dependence of the cohesive energy on the In content. A microscopic interpretation for this general trend is given in terms of the key contributions to chemical bonding in this class of compounds, namely Cu d-electron overlap and hybridization of Cu d-states with In and Sn p-electron states. Moreover, a crystallographic site approach is developed to accurately establish the phase-stabilizing effect of incorporating In at specific Wyckoff positions of the (mC44) η′-Cu6Sn5structure.},

The work relies upon a database with total-energy versus volume information developed by using projected augmented waves (PAW) calculations. In previous papers by the current authors it was shown that these results account satisfactorily for the direct and indirect experimental data available. In the present work, the database is further expanded to investigate the composition dependence of the volume (V0), and the composition and volume dependence of the bulk modulus (B0) and cohesive energy (Ecoh). On these bases, an analysis is performed of the systematic effects of replacing Cu by Ni in several Me-X phases (Me=Cu,Ni and X=In,Sn) reported as stable and metastable, as well as various hypothetical compounds involved in the thermodynamic modeling of IPs using the Compound-Energy Formalism. Moreover, it is shown that the cohesion-related quantities (B0/V0)-and (Ecoh-/V0) can be correlated with a parameter expressing the number of valence electrons per unit volume. These findings are compared in detail with related relations involving the Miedema empirical electron density at the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz cell. In view of the co-variation of the cohesive properties, Ecohis selected as a key property and its composition and structure dependence is examined in terms of a theoretical view of the bonding which involves the hybridization of the d-states of Cu or Ni with the s and p-states of In or Sn, for this class of compounds. In particular, a comparative analysis is performed of the DOS of various representative, iso-structural Me-X compounds. Various effects of relevance to understand the consequences of replacing Cu by Ni in LFS alloys are highlighted and explained microscopically for the first time.},

  abstract = {The physico-chemical properties of the intermetallic phases in the Cu-In system have been a matter of considerable theoretical and experimental interest in connection with, i.a., the application of In-Sn alloys as lead-free micro-soldering alloys. Recently, a new binary compound with the chemical formula Cu10In7has been detected in a study of the η-phase field. The structure of the Cu10In7phase has been determined as closely related to that of the Cu11In9compound occurring in the phase diagram, but no experimental or theoretical information on its electronic structure, thermodynamic and equation-of-state properties has yet been reported. In the present work we report the lattice parameters, bulk modulus, energy of formation from the constituent elements and the electronic structure of the new phase, calculated by applying an ab initio density-functional-theory method. Our calculation technique uses the projector augmented wave potentials and the exchange-correlation functions of Perdew and Wang in the generalized gradient approximation. The present results for the Cu10In7phase are compared with the experimental data available, and with the trends in structural and thermodynamic properties emerging from ab initio calculations also performed in the present study for various structurally related and neighboring compounds in the Cu-In phase diagram, viz., the ideal B82-Cu2In, B81-CuIn, B82-CuIn2phases and the Cu11In9compound. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The present study of the thermodynamic and cohesive properties of Ni-In/Sn intermetallic phases should contribute to the understanding of the phase-stability systematics in the Ni-In-Sn system and the design of new soldering alloys. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The thermodynamic modeling of non-stoichiometric, multisublattice intermetallic phases using the Compound-Energy Formalism (CEF) involves the determination of parameters representing the Gibbs energy (Gm) of binary compounds, the so-called "end-member compounds" (EMCs), which are often metastable or hypothetical. In current CALPHAD (i.e., "Calculation of Phase Diagrams") work, these quantities are treated as free parameters to be determined by searching for the best fit to the available information in the optimization procedure. The general purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical approach to the study of the EMCs which makes use of density-functional-theory (DFT) ab initio calculations. The present method is applied to the EMCs involved in the CEF modeling of the non-stoichiometric (hP6) Ni2In-structure type phase of the Ni-In and Ni-In-Sn systems using the three-sublattice models (Ni)1(Ni,Va)1(In,Ni)1and (Ni,Va)1(Ni,Va)1(In,Ni,Sn)1, respectively. By means of systematic ab initio projected augmented waves (PAW) calculations using the VASP code we study the EMCs involved in the CEF formulations of the Gmfor this phase in the binary and the ternary systems. Specifically, we study the twelve EMCs corresponding to the following sublattice occupations: (Ni)1(Ni)1(In)1, which is usually described as Ni:Ni:In (i.e., a compound with formula "Ni2In"), Ni:Ni:Ni (i.e., "Ni3"), Ni:Ni:Sn ("Ni2Sn"), Ni:Va:In (i.e., "NiIn"), Ni:Va:Ni (i.e., "Ni2"), Ni:Va:Sn ("NiSn"), Va:Ni:In ("NiIn"), Va:Ni:Ni ("Ni2"), Va:Ni:Sn ("NiSn"), Va:Va:In ("In"), Va:Va:Ni ("Ni"), and Va:Va:Sn ("Sn"). For the listed EMCs, we report the lattice-parameters, the volume per atom, the electronic density of states and various types of cohesive properties usually taken as macroscopic manifestations of the bonding strength, viz., the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative, the cohesive energy and the energy of formation from the elements. Trends in these quantities are established as a function of the occupation of the various sublattices by the different components and discussed in terms of the interactions between d electrons of the transition element as well as the hybridization between them and the s and p electrons of the non-transition metal. In addition to the reported thermodynamic information of direct use as input in the CALPHAD optimizations, the picture of the variations in cohesive properties emerging from the present work should be useful in systematizing the thermophysical and structural database for this class of compounds.},

  abstract = {Noble/transition bimetallic nanowires of nominal composition Fe90Rh10 are AC electrodeposited into 20 nm diameter hexagonally self-assembled alumina nanopores. Nanowires about 18 nm in diameter and 1 μm long are polycrystalline and multiphase. Wires contain α-Fe grains and very small grains of the ClCs-type α′-Fe(Rh) phase. The room temperature magnetization mechanism and the thermal stability of nanowire magnetic configurations are further investigated by measuring the dependence of the coercive field on the applied field sweeping rate R. From these data a mean fluctuations field value of μ0HFR = (9.0 ± 0.5) mT is obtained (at coercivity) and an effective activation magnetic moment μac = 5400 μB is estimated, with μB the Bohr magneton. At the coercive field (about 45 mT) the resulting activation lengths become lAC ≈ 6.4 and 6.7 nm for α-Fe and α′-Fe(Rh), respectively. Assuming an effective magnetic anisotropy, considering magnetostatic shape contributions in addition to the magnetocrystalline one, the domain wall thickness δw in α-Fe grains and in the α′-Fe(Rh) become δwFe = 13.4 nm and δwFeRh = 10.9 nm respectively. These values are comparable to the activation lengths estimated at the coercive field in each phase. These facts strongly indicate that irreversible polarization reversal in these nanowires takes place by local curling, involving localized nucleation modes.},

  abstract = {The manufacture of alloys in solid state has many differences with the conventional melting (casting) process. In the case of high energy milling or mechanical alloying, phase transformations of the raw materials are promoted by a large amount of energy that is introduced by impact with the grinding medium; there is no melting, but the microstructural changes go from microstructural refinement to amorphization in solid state. This work studies the behavior of pure metals (Cu and Ni), and different binary alloys (Cu-Ni and Cu-Zr), under the same milling/mechanical alloying conditions. After high-energy milling, X ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were analyzed to determine changes in the lattice parameter and find both microstrain and crystallite sizes, which were first calculated using the Williamson-Hall (W-H) method and then compared with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. Calculations showed a relatively appropriate approach to observations with TEM; however, in general, TEM observations detect heterogeneities, which are not considered for the W-H method. As for results, in the set of pure metals, we show that pure nickel undergoes more microstrain deformations, and is more abrasive than copper (and copper alloys). In binary systems, there was a complete solid solution in the Cu-Ni system and a glass-forming ability for the Cu-Zr, as a function of the Zr content. Mathematical methods cannot be applied when the systems have amorphization because there are no equations representing this process during milling. A general conclusion suggests that, under the same milling conditions, results are very different due to the significant impact of the composition: nickel easily forms a solid solution, while with a higher zirconium content there is a higher degree of glass-forming ability.},

The final goal of this work is the preparation of 80SiO2·20B2O3films for active optical waveguides doped with Ag nanoparticles and Erbium. We are looking for the reinforcement of the fluorescence intensity due to the effect of the resonant coupling of both optical agents (Er and nanoparticles) to produce optical amplifiers. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The β Cu-Zn-Al alloys undergo pseudo-elastic martensitic transformations or plastic deformations under an applied stress depending on the temperature and alloy composition. It is of particular interest to study the interactions between both deformation modes. In this paper a detailed study of the plastic deformation in the β phase of Cu-Zn-Al alloys is carried out around room temperature. The stress-strain behaviour shows that the addition of Al increases the critical resolved shear stress for plastic deformation compared with that of binary Cu-Zn. Optical and electron microscopy observations show that the slip direction is [111] and the glide planes are (112) in the twinning sense or a combination of \{123\}-type planes when the (112) is no longer operative. In no case is slip observed on the (101) or on the (211) antitwinning plane. The effect of the L21 long-range ordering on the dislocation characteristics is also investigated. In particular, it is found that the superlattice dislocations split into partials. A pair of dislocations is observed separated by a distance of about 3 nm and joined by a ribbon of nearest-neighbour antiphase boundary (APB). The dislocation pairs move as in a B2-type superlattice dragging next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) APBs because of the low value of the NNN APB energy compared with the applied stress multiplied by the Burgers vector.},

  abstract = {The critical stress to induce martensite in Cu-Zn and Cu-Zn-AI single crystals has been determined down to 80 K. It has been found that the stress increases linearly with increasing temperature. From this result it is deduced that the higher vibrational entropy of the P-phase compared with the martensite is due solely to the soft transverse [ EEO] phonon modes, the other modes remaining largely unaffected by the transformation. This result is consistent with the predictions of Zener on the stability of P-phases in the noble-metal alloys. The linearity in the temperature dependence of the critical stress has been used to obtain transformation temperatures by a linear extrapolation to zero stress. The results for alloys with Zn concentrations between 40 and 43 at.\% Zn can be expressed as M, (K) = 2686 - 64Czn. This dependence is different from what has been reported in the literature before. Finally, the influences of previous plastic deformation in the /3-phase and of a stressinduced transformation of the martensite to the FCT phase are considered.},

A quasi-static method was used to simulate crack propagation and the atomic interactions were described by the embedded-atom (EAM) type potentials. We analyzed the influence of H atoms on the deformation mechanisms and phase transformations taking place near the crack tip loaded in Mode I. Crack advance was monitored as a function of the applied stress intensity and it was found to depend on the geometry and orientation of the crack and on the specific position of the H interstitials. As in pure Zr, twinning, dislocations, hcp to fcc and hcp to bcc martensitic transformations near the crack tip are competing deformation mechanisms. Dilute amounts of interstitial H in the crack tip region significantly affect this competition. The results indicate that for most orientations the presence of dilute H interstitials leads to an increase in ductility. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results indicate that the behavior of single crystals is similar to that of polycrystals unless the grain boundaries are embrittled in the high temperature phase β. For fatigue in the martensitic state, several intra-martensitic crack nucleation mechanisms provide conditions for which no considerable differences occur between single and polycrystals.

  abstract = {Abstract The martensitic transformation is often accompanied by the production of defects either in the austenite, the martensite or in both phases. An interesting example of this is the generation of bulk dislocations and surface defects after pseudoelastic cycling in Cu-Zn-Al single crystals. The involved phases are the cubic (L21) of the austenite and the monoclinic 18R martensitic phase. The dislocations arrange in the bulk following crystallographic patterns associated to the habit plane of the transition and the basal plane of the martensite. A microscopic analysis shows that the dislocations are produced by plastic deformation of the martensite. These dislocations have several consequences on the mechanical behavior of the material and on the kinetics of the diffusional processes present in both phases. The formation of intrusions and extrusions at the surface specimens is another important effect of the pseudoelastic cycling. They play a crucial role on the fatigue life of the specimens. Recent results show a strong effect of composition on the nucleation of surface defects. The crystallography of the defects, the origin of the dislocations, their arrangements and their interaction with the specimen surface are discussed.},

The transformation temperatures and the critical stresses to induce the martensitic transition are affected by diffusive phenomena taking place both in the parent phase and in martensite. Pseudoelastic cycles were used to obtain quantitative data concerning the effect of diffusive phenomena like stabilization of martensite, ordering of the parent phase under load and recovery of this phase on the critical stresses to transform. Information was then obtained on changes in the relative phase stability. A model is presented to explain those changes taking place in the parent phase aged under load and in the martensitic 18R structure. Experimental data on the kinetics of diffusive phenomena is also presented and analyzed.},

  abstract = {Grain size has a strong effect on the pseudoelastic properties of shape-memory alloys. Different grain sizes and several related phenomena are studied. This involves the dependence of the transformation and retransformation stresses on grain size and on the amount of transformed material. A pronounced drop of transformation stresses on cycling is observed, until an asymptotic behavior is reached. This is related to the creation of defects (dislocations and dislocation arrays) and microplates of martensite, which are the defects necessary to allow the grains to accommodate due to the shape change imposed by the martensitic transformation. The asymptotic hysteresis is related to the internal work for the grains to accommodate each other once the necessary defects were created. The asymptotic hysteresis increases linearly as the grain size decreases. A simple model shows that the slope is related to the (d/. e) ratio, where d is the average grain size and e is the width of the specimen. This effect arises from the presence of the free surfaces that release the plastic work for grain accommodation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The effects of the repeated stress-induced transformation (pseudoelastic fatigue) on the mechanical behaviour and microstructure of Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni single crystals are presented. Several microstructural changes occur during cycling at temperatures above the martensitic transformation temperature M-s in Cu-Zn-Al alloys. Bulk defects consisting of dislocation bands with retained martensite and intrusion-extrusion types of surface defects are observed. The fine characteristics of the defects, such as nucleation, density, as well as other microstructural features, depend on the working temperature, alloy composition, applied stresses and number of cycles. The presence of these defects alters the shape of the stress-strain curves in the pseudoelastic range for Cu-Zn-Al. Also diffusive phenomena strongly affect the mechanical behaviour of these alloys both in the parent and martensite phases, even for tests carried out slightly above room temperature. In turn, the kinetics of these diffusional processes has been found to depend on the density of bulk defects. Details of these processes are discussed and a simple model that describes the main characteristics of the mechanical behaviour evolution is considered. The interaction between the mechanical behaviour, density of defects and diffusion is discussed. In the case of Cu-Al-Ni, bulk defects are also shown to occur but the system is less prone to diffusion effects that could affect the mechanical behaviour. The defects generated during pseudoelastic cycling lead, however, to the inhibition of the gamma' phase when a transition between the bcc parent phase and a mixture of two martensitic structures gamma' (2H) and beta' (18R) is involved at the beginning of the cycling process.},

  abstract = {CuAlBe shape memory alloys exhibit successive reversible stress induced martensitic transformations from austenite to 18R phase and from 18R to 6R phase. The particularities associated with these transformations result in CuAlBe being an attractive candidate material for damping applications. Recently, a stress-temperature phase transformation diagram has been proposed for this system, which, besides the above mentioned phases, also includes the structural distortion of the 18R previous to its stress induced transformation to 6R. In the present work, pseudoelastic cycling of CuAlBe single crystals has been performed at different test temperatures. Both transitions, i.e., austenite-18R and 18R-6R, have been studied. As hysteresis plays a significant role in shape-memory alloys intended to be used for energy dissipation, special attention has been devoted to its evolution during cycling. In addition, the kinetics of stabilization of martensites has been analyzed under dynamic (pseudoelastic cycling) and quasistatic (constant transformed fraction) conditions. A strong enhancement of martensitic stabilization under dynamic conditions compared with stabilization at quasistatic conditions was observed and the possible mechanisms responsible for the effect are mentioned.},

Tensile tests performed at slow crosshead speed show a dependence of the hysteresis associated to the stress induced β-18R transformation with temperature. The critical stresses of the β-18R transition have been determined giving a negative curvature parabolic dependence on temperature. The effect is more noticeable for the retransformation stress and a consequent increment in the stress hysteresis with temperature is observed. The deformation associated to the stress induced β-18R transition has also been found to depend on temperature. These singular features associated with the pseudoelastic behavior of Cu-Al-Be single crystals have been rationalized in terms of a structural distortion of the 18R martensite that has been found to occur in the considered temperature range. The strain associated to the structural distortion was determined as well as the dependence of its critical stress on temperature. The resulting entropy change was thus calculated, resulting fifty times smaller than the entropy change between the bcc parent phase and 18R.

The obtained nanotubes have a multiwall structure, and 70\% of vanadium ions are in the V 4+ state. This percentage was derived by evaluating three components of the magnetic susceptibility; namely, (i) the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior, (ii) antiferromagnetic dimers, and (iii) magnetic trimers. The as-made NTs were annealed in situ in the cavity of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The line shape changes irreversibly at 390 K, and the EPR susceptibility presents an anomaly at 425 K. These changes are interpreted as a partial oxidation of the V 4+ ions and consequently a decrease in the concentration of the magnetic species. The quantification of the V 4+ ions of the annealed NTs reveals a diminution to 39\% of V 4+, a weakening of the Curie-Weiss and antiferromagnetic dimers contributions, and the suppression of magnetic trimers.

The same critical thickness was also estimated from in-plane magnetization vs field measurements. From the MFM images we have also found that the stripe period is an increasing function of the film thickness following a square root law. These data were interpreted with two different models that yield parameters (magnetization, anisotropy, and exchange stiffness) compatible with those determined from magnetization measurements. Films with thicknesses above dcr show a strong dependence of the domain configuration on the magnetic history. Rotatable anisotropy was found in these samples, with a rotational anisotropy field that became stronger with the increase in film thickness. Bubblelike domains could be also observed when the sample is saturated perpendicular to the film plane. All magnetic measurements as a function of film thickness can be interpreted using the same values of magnetization, anisotropy, and exchange stiffness.},

  abstract = {We measured the anelastic spectra of LaMnO3. An internal friction peak appears at 300-350 K depending on the sample preparation. Two methods of preparation of the sample were used changing also the sintering time and temperature The IF peak disappears when the sample was sintered for 79 h at 1400 C. The grains show soldered. When the grains are not soldered an IF peak is obtained with its corresponding modulus drop. Applying the theory of grain-boundary sliding, proposed by C. Zener in 1941, the Poisson ratio χ=0.38(5) and 0.43(5) could be obtained. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Previous 3 2/3 1 /3 work [1] showed that the modulus becomes higher while the internal friction has a peak at the transition temperature (T 5262 K). In this c work, improvements made on the equipment allowed us to measure at constant deformations ( ,10 ) and magnetic fields up to 4500 ´ 25 Gauss. We made isothermal measurements of internal friction, modulus and resistance as a function of an applied magnetic field. We found that most of the changes induced by the magnetic field take place in a few degrees (almost 5 K) near the transition temperature where the changes in resistance are more important. Up to the highest magnetic field applied, we found 3\% maximum variations of the modulus and no hysteresis while cycling the magnetic field.We suppose that the experiment is placed in the linear response of the inverse Wiedemann effect [2], due to the small deformations used, and that the ferromagnetic domain structure is responsible for the observed effects. Some additional measurements are needed (magnetic hysteresis loops) to be compared with our results.},

  abstract = {Nanostructured Nd60Fe30Al10magnetic alloys were obtained by melt spinning at a tangential wheel speed of 5 m/s. Magnetic and stress relaxation processes were investigated in the as cast condition. Low frequency mechanical spectroscopy studies (dynamic elastic torsion modulus and internal damping measurements) were conducted at fixed frequencies between 0.1 and 1 Hz, in the range [150-480 K]. The low temperature internal damping and dynamic elastic modulus exhibited a large heating-cooling hysteresis and two damping peaks: one due to a stress induced relaxation mechanism operating near 200 K [1 Hz] and another one, at about 260-270 K, which could not be correlated with any step in the modulus, indicating that it is not anelastic in origin. The high temperature damping was described by an exponential background and a broad peak contribution centered at about 400 K (1 Hz). The resulting maximum is frequency dependent, but it is little sensitive to applied fields up to 30 mT. On contrary, the elastic modulus behavior associated to this maximum resulted largely affected by frequency, the external fields and the magnetic state of the sample. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Several TEM techniques were used and HT-XRD experiments performed to determine the crystal structure and the morphological microstructure of the samples obtained during different heat treatments. The heat treatments were: quenching from 850 °C to room temperature and two consecutive calorimetric runs at 5 °C/min. After the quenching,α2is the major phase observed, reaching 95 mass\%. The remaining 5 mass\% consisted of martensitic phases: one sample had γ′, a hexagonal structure, and the other β1′, a rhombohedral structure. During the first calorimetric run, the sample containing the γ′ phase exhibited a calorimetric event and the sample containing the β1′ phase did not. The calorimetric event is attributed to the austenitic transformation γ′ → β1. The lack of calorimetric event in the sample containing the β1′ is associated with the inhibition of the transformation β1′ → β1because of the precipitation of the γ2phase. Finally, the absence of a calorimetric event in the second run with the first sample is associated with the retransformation to β1′ instead to γ′ phase during cooling of the first calorimetric run. These studies determined that the first sample is a better candidate than the second sample to produce a shape memory alloy after thermo-mechanical treatments of the milled powders.},

  abstract = {The lattice parameters have been measured for 6R, 18R and 2H CuZnAl martensites. Whereas 6R is nearly cubic f.c.c., the 18R and 2H are strongly distorted. The relationship between the MS temperature and the distortion is the same for stabilized and nonstabilized martensite. On the basis of the experimental results the stabilities of the different phases are discussed. The enthalpy differences between disordered f.c.c. and b.c.c. agree well with first principle calculations. The lattice distortion leads to an increase in the stability of 18R, and to a reduction of the composition dependence of MS. Nous avons mesuré les paramètres réticulaires des martensites CuZnAl 6R, 18R et 2H. Alors que la structure 6R est pratiquement c.f.c., les structures 18R et 2H sont très distordues. La relation entre la température MS et la distorsion est la même pour la martensite stabilisée et pour la martensite non stabilisée. Nous discutons la stabilité des différentes phases à partir de nos résultats expérimentaux. Les différences d'enthalpie entre la structure c.f.c. désordonnée et la structure c.c. sont en bon accord avec des calculs fondamentaux. La distorsion du réseau conduit à un accroissement de la stabilité de la structure 18R, et à une réduction de l'effet de la composition sur MS. Die Gitterkonstanten wurden für 6R, 18R und 2H Martensit in CuZnAl Legierungen gemessen. Während 6R fast kubisch flächenzentriert ist, sind 18R und 2H stark verzerrt. Die Beziehung zwischen MS Temperatur und Gitterverzerung ist dieselbe für stabilisierten und nichtstabilisierten Martensit. Basierend auf den experimentellen Ergebnissen werden die Stabilitäten der verschiedenen Phasen diskutiert. Die Enthalpieunterschiede zwischen ungeordneten f.c.c. und b.c.c. stimmen gut mit ab initio Berechnungen überein. Die Gitterverzerrungen bewirken eine zusätzliche Stabilität des 18R Martensits und eine Verringerung der Konzentrationsabhängigkeit von MS.},

In the present study, the alternating current potential drop (ACPD) technique is used to analyze the change in electrical resistance of ultra-fine grained NiTi wires subjected to a broad range of thermo-mechanical load cases: (i) uniaxial tensile straining at constant temperatures (pseudoelastic deformation); (ii) cooling and heating through the transformation range at constant load (actuator load case); (iii) a combination of mechanical and thermal loading. We monitor the ACPD signals in several zones along the gauge length of specimens, and we demonstrate that a localized type of transformation is a generic feature of pseudoelastic as well as of shape memory deformation. Moreover, the ACPD signals allow to differentiate between temperature-induced martensite (formed during cooling at no or relatively small loads), stress-induced martensite, and reoriented martensite (formed under load at low temperatures).},

Furthermore, amperometric reagentless detection of glucose and contactless photonic biosensing by the Os(II) resonant Raman signal have been demonstrated. The enzymatic reduction of FAD by glucose and further reduction of the Raman silent Os(III) by FADH 2 yields a characteristic enzyme-substrate calibration curve in the millimolar range.

  abstract = {Manganese oxides with distorted perovskite structure have attracted much attention during the last decade due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), and the strong correlations among the various degrees of freedom involved. In particular, Pr1-xCaxMnO3compounds present in a wide Ca-doping range a charge ordering phenomenon, consisting of real space ordering of Mn3+and Mn4+in alternate lattice sites below a certain temperature TCO. This ordering brings about a lattice distortion and a large hardening of the sound velocity below TCO. Tomioka et al. have observed that an applied magnetic field can melt this charge ordered state and induce a transition from an insulating to a metallic state. In order to study the effects of this charge order melting, ultrasonic longitudinal sound velocity measurements were performed on polycrystalline Pr1-xCaxMnO3(x=0.35 and 0.5) as a function of magnetic field and temperature. Interesting anomalies were found related to the melting of the charge ordered phase into a metal-like state even at low temperatures. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Milling for 100 h without interruptions the three elements simultaneously gave the best ratio between the amount of β phase and the milling time. Low temperature thermal treatments to the powders (up to 450 C) lead to γ phase crystallite growth, with the amount of β phase remaining nearly constant. With anneals at 800 C the β phase fraction in the powder increased solely to 86\%. A sample of pure β phase was obtained only after warm compaction at 680 MPa and sintering at temperatures above 800 C. In addition, it was necessary to reach temperatures of 900 C in order to have a material that transforms martensitically. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The formulations were named SPION-PEG350 and SPION-PEG2000. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements show that the SPIONs are near-spherical, well-crystalline, and have high saturation magnetization and susceptibility. FTIR spectroscopy identifies the presence of oleic acid and of the conjugates mPEG for each sample. In vitro biocompatibility of SPIONS was investigated using three cell lines; up to 100 μg/ml SPION-PEG350 showed non-toxicity, while SPION-PEG2000 showed no signal of toxicity even up to 200 μg/ml. The uptake of SPIONS was detected using magnetization measurement, confocal and atomic force microscopy. SPION-PEG2000 presented the highest internalization capacity, which should be correlated with the mPEG chain size. The in vivo results suggested that SPION-PEG2000 administration in mice triggered liver and kidney injury.},

Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and transport and magnetic measurements were performed to analyze the influence of the implantation process in the physical properties of the films. CAFM images show regions with different conductivity values, probably due to the random distribution of point defect. The transport and magnetic properties of these systems are interpreted in this context. Metal-insulator transition can be described in the frame of a percolative model. Disorder increases the distance between conducting regions, lowering the observed TMI. Point-defect disorder increases localization of the carriers due to increased disorder and locally enhanced strain field. Remarkably, even with the inhomogeneous nature of the samples, no sign of low-field magnetoresistance was found. Point-defect disorder decreases the system magnetization but does not seem to change the magnetic transition temperature. The coercive field of the samples increases linearly with increasing disorder but decreases when disorder is higher than a critical value.},

  abstract = {A Focused Ion Beam (FIB)/lift-out technique was used to prepare site-specific thin samples of the cathode/electrolyte interface of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC) materials. The cathode under study was a nanostructured perovskite of composition La0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ(LSCF) deposited by spin coating on a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ(CGO) supporting substrate. We compared the results for a 15 μm and a 5 μm thickness cathode layers, before and after a thermal treatment of 1000 h at 500 °C, with the aim of simulating operation conditions. Both, Transmission (TEM) and Scanning (SEM) Electron Microscopy, coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) systems, were used to characterize the composition and nanostructure at both sides of the cathode/electrolyte interface. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a semi-coherent interface between LSCF and CGO was observed by Electron Diffraction as well as by High Resolution TEM in many points at the interfacial boundary. A large difference in total contact area was observed between the thickest and the thinnest cathode layers, despite they present the same composition and nano sized structure. The real contact area in the 5 μm cathode sample is around 50\% less than in the 15 μm sample due to the presence of pores at the interface. This observation may partially explain the difference in resistivity observed for these two half cells assemblies. On the other side, no differences were found comparing composition and nanostructure at the interface before and after the thermal treatment. Thus, this study becomes fundamental to understand the role played by the interface for improving the performance of IT-SOFC under long time operation conditions: a necessary premise for its real application. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

These samples present a reaction layer of 10 nm thickness, which contains elements of both phases and was found responsible of the cell performance degradation. On the other hand, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathodes showed excelent performance on Ceria electrolytes, even after 1 000 h at operation conditions. In that case, the microscopic analyses of FIB foils showed a semi-coherent interphase growth.}

Additionally, the η region shows a gradual change in composition, suggesting a change from the Cu6Sn5to the Cu2In structures. Thermal stability tests indicate that the thermal resistance of the bonds is about 750 °C. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A 1-D thermomechanical model aimed to represent the behavior of Ni-rich ultrafine grained NiTi wires upon pseudoelastic cycling was developed. The three more significant features associated to the pseudoelastic behavior of NiTi wires were taken into consideration for its formulation. These are: the localized character of the stress induced transformation which is accompanied by the nucleation and propagation of a discrete number of transformation fronts; the thermal effects associated with the heat of transformation and the Clausius-Clapeyron type of dependence of critical stresses with temperature; the functional fatigue effects resulting in the decrease of critical stresses and the accumulation of permanent deformation during cycling. The model assesses the mechanical response by evaluating the local conditions at the different moving interfaces that might be present at a certain time. It was implemented in MATLAB and numerical simulations have been found to exhibit good agreement with experimental results obtained under similar conditions. It is therefore considered that the model here proposed constitutes a good conceptualization of the complex pseudoelastic behavior of NiTi wires that allows reproducing the fundamental aspects of actual observed behaviors},

Interest in lattice structures resides not only in the possibility of obtaining efficient lightweight materials, but also in the functionality of pre-designed architectured structures for specific applications, such as biomimetic implants, chemical catalyzers, and heat transfer devices. The mechanical behaviour of lattice structures depends not only the composition of the base material, but also on the type and size of the unit cells, as well as on the material microstructure resulting from a specific fabrication procedure. The present work focuses on the static and fatigue behavior of diamond cell lattice structures fabricated from an AlSiMg alloy by laser powder bed fusion technology. In particular, the specimens were fabricated with three different orientations of lattice cells—[001], [011], [111]—and subjected to static tensile testing and force-controlled pull–pull fatigue testing up to 1 × 107 cycles. In parallel, the mechanical behavior of dense tensile plain and notched specimens was also studied and compared to that of their lattice counterparts. Results showed a significant effect of the cell orientation on the fatigue lives: specimens oriented at [001] were \textasciitilde 30\% more fatigue-resistant than specimens oriented at [011] and [111].},

  abstract = {The hysteretic damping capacity and high recoverable strains characterizing the superelastic response of shape memory alloys (SMA) make these materials attractive for protection systems of structures subjected to dynamic loads. A successful implementation however is conditioned by functional fatigue exhibited by the SMA when subjected to cyclic loading. The residual deformation upon cycling and the efficiency in material usage are the two most restrictive issues in this sense. In this paper, a device equipped with superelastic NiTi SMA wires and capable of supporting external tension compression loads with optimized properties is presented. It is shown how the introduction of the wires' pre-straining allows for the absorption of deleterious residual deformation without affecting the self-centering capabilities upon unloading, in contrast with what occurs for pre-strained tendons. These features were experimentally verified in an in-scale prototype composed of two 1.2 mm diameter superelastic NiTi SMA wires. In order to numerically assess the dynamic response of a simple structure subjected to seismic excitations, a multilinear superelasticity model for the NiTi wires was developed. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The hard magnetic properties of melt spun Nd60Fe30Al10alloys are attributed to a major matrix nominally amorphous for X-ray diffraction, composed by two metastable nanosized (∼5 nm) phases with different intrinsic magnetic properties. This composite system is investigated for the first time by mechanical spectroscopy techniques in the temperature range between 50 K and 450 K (1 kHz) where large annealing effects and two damping phenomena are detected. The as-cast microstructure irreversibly changes during annealing above 330 K, leading to a large modulus recovery accompanied by a reduction in the internal friction level. A relatively large relaxation effect is observed about 290 K, evidenced by a narrow internal friction peak with the corresponding step in the elastic modulus; this peak remains stable under thermal cycling between 200 K and 300 K but is affected by aging at 330 K and practically vanishes after heating to 450 K. Another internal friction peak is observed at about 250 K which has associated an anomalous modulus effect; in this temperature range, the internal friction and the elastic modulus exhibit heating/cooling hysteresis, which strongly depends on the extreme temperatures of the thermal cycle, a behavior frequently associated to first-order phase transformations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic (AFM) Cr2 O3 nanoparticles have been studied as a function of the nanoparticle size. The synthesized nanoparticles present an ellipsoidal shape with the major axis of approximately 170 nm and the minor axis that increases with the synthesis temperature from 30 to 70 nm. By magnetization and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, we have obtained the parameters that characterize the AFM nanoparticles system. We have found that the Néel temperature, TN, and the spin-flop field, HSF, increase with the particle size from TN =288 K and HSF (5 K) =10 kOe for the smaller nanoparticles and approach the bulk values [TN =308 K and HSF (5 K) =60 kOe] for the larger particles. From the experimental results and the molecular-field theory applied to AFM coupled sublattices, we estimated the magnetic anisotropy, K, and the molecular-field constant, λ, as a function of the Cr2 O3 nanoparticle size. When the size is reduced, λ only diminishes ∼8\% with respect to its bulk value (4.9× 104 Oe2 g/erg); instead, K decreases more than an order of magnitude from K=3.8× 104 to 8.7× 102 erg/g. We analyzed the results on the basis of a core shell model where the nanoparticle internal order consists of an antiferromagnetically ordered core and a disordered surface shell, which presents a frustrated magnetic state. ©2008 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {We have characterized the elevated temperature (190 °C) precipitation sequence near the grain boundaries of an AlCuSiGe alloy, comparing these results to the binary AlCu and the ternary AlSiGe. In the quaternary alloy, there is a graded microstructure that evolves with increasing distance from the boundaries, which is generally a superposition of the precipitate-free-zones (PFZs) in the binary AlCu and in the ternary AlSiGe. After aging for 3 h, this graded area consists of an approximately 140 nm wide region that is entirely precipitate free, followed by a 400 nm wide region that is denuded of Si-Ge and θ′ precipitates. Rather than containing the (Si-Ge)-θ′ pairs observed in the bulk, this 400 nm wide region contains only homogeneously nucleated θ″. Only in the overaged condition (144 h) are the near grain boundary θ″ replaced by a coarse distribution of large plate-like θ′. In the alloys, the solute depleted zones are much narrower than the total length of the PFZ. For example, in both AlCu and AlCuSiGe, the Cu depleted zone is only 30 nm wide. This underscores the need for vacancies during precipitation of not only θ′ and Si-Ge, but of θ″ as well. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

At room temperature or above, irradiation with neutrons or electrons in the β-phase produced no changes in the β → 18R transformation temperature. However, irradiation in the 18R phase shifted the 18R → β transformation temperature towards higher values. The shift in the transformation temperature increased by irradiating to a higher dose or at a higher temperature. Electron irradiation at 124 K in the β-phase again produced no changes in the β → 18R transformation temperature. Electron irradiation at 95 K in several 18R samples with transformation temperatures of 173, 238, 263 and 350 K produced no changes in the 18R → β transformation temperature except for those samples with a transformation temperature of 350 K in which a shift towards higher temperature occurred. The changes in the 18R → β transformation temperature were found to be due to the stabilization of the 18R phase with respect to the β-phase by radiation enhanced diffusion. The kinetics of the stabilization by irradiation is discussed with a simple model for radiation enhanced diffusion.},

An abrupt change in composition between core and shell was indicated by both, energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and high resolution phase contrast imaging.

  abstract = {Abstract Irradiation experiments with 2 MeV protons were carried out in Cu-Zn-Al 18R martensite. It was found that the enhanced diffusion brought about by the irradiation caused the stabilization of the 18R martensite. This behaviour is similar to that reported previously for electron irradiation. The stabilization kinetics were studied as a function of the displacement rate k 0. The time necessary to obtain a given degree of stabilization was found to depend on k 0 −0·6. By comparison with previous electron irradiation experiments, an efficiency of about 0·26 was obtained for the production of freely migrating defects by 2 MeV proton irradiation relative to 2·6 MeV electron irradiation. The kinetics of stabilization under proton and electron irradiation could be described by a simple model based on rate equations.},

The microstructural characterization was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), specifically, diffraction contrast and high-resolution imaging. The S phase was found to precipitate heterogeneously on dislocations in both nondeformed and pre-deformed alloys. After the same artificial aging time, a larger density of S phase precipitates was obtained in the pre-deformed specimens. In non-deformed specimens, a high density of small nanometer-sized aggregates was found, that was absent in the pre-deformed specimens, that were identified as GP zones. To further analyze the small sized aggregates, artificially aged specimens with no previous deformation were also studied with Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) of positron annihilation radiation. With this technique, information on the chemical environment around vacancy sites contained in the GP zones was obtained. Specifically, a composition close to (AlCu)2Mg was derived.},

The cable oscillations are induced by wind, rain or traffic. The SMA and their solid-solid phase transformation permits effective damping via the hysteresis cycle and the conversion of mechanical work in heat. The analysis of SMA behavior needs to be strictly coherent with the requirements associated to the application. In particular, the high requirement on working cycles induced by a strong storm of 3 or 4 days, the temperature – stress dependence of the phase transformation (via Clausius-Clapeyron equation), the self-heating effects, the SMA creep and the eventual effects of aging (temperature and time) on the transformation temperatures (i.e., atomic order and/or other effects) were studied. The SMA was applied to mitigate the oscillations induced in realistic cables in ELSA (45 m length) with positive results, and in the LCPC facility (50 m length), always with equivalent simulation tests. The experimental examples suggest that the SMA permit an effective reduction of the oscillation amplitudes better than a half. The work is realized in the frame of SMARTeR, one S3T-ESF project their goal is the damping in stayed cables of bridges. For instance, the Iroise bridge in the highway between Brest and Plougastel, France, or eventually in the St. Nazaire bridge in the “Loire Atlantique” near Nantes or other bridges (i.e. the “Viaducs du Boulonnais” in the A16 highway, France).},

  abstract = {The use of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) in technical applications as damping in civil engineering structures requires the characterization of the alloy for each specific application. This involves the evolution of the mechanical properties and damping capacity with the number of cycles, frequency, maximum deformation, applied stresses, and the evolution of the alloy with aging time and temperature. In particular, the temperature effects associated to self-heating need to be evaluated. In continuous cycling the effects of latent heat, the associated dissipation induced by the hysteresis, the heat flow to surroundings and the cycling frequency induce different states of temperature in the specimen, which in turn produces changes in the transformation-retransformation stresses. In this article, the temperature effects associated to cycling are outlined for different cycling frequencies. The results show that, for relatively faster frequency the temperature arrives at an oscillatory state superimposed to an exponential increase. For lower frequencies, some parts of the sample attain temperatures below room temperature. The experimental results are represented with an elementary model (the 1-body model or the Tian equation used in calorimetric representation) of heat transfer. For the higher fracture where life requirements are associated to damping in stayed cables for bridges, the results show (for the NiTi alloy) a reduction of the hysteresis width as the frequency increases for deformations up to 8\%. For reduced deformation, under 2\% appears an asymptotic behavior where the frictional area is practically independent of the cycling frequency (up to 20 Hz). In addition, it is shown that more than 4 million of working cycles can be attained if the maximum applied stress is kept below a threshold of about 200 MPa. Although under this condition the deformation must remain lower than 2\% a reasonable damping capacity can still be obtained.},

The paper presents the design and optimization methodology for the dampers, analyzes their performance, and quantifies the relevant physical effects from the experimental measurements. The simulation results show that the SMA dampers are capable of reducing the maximum oscillation amplitude induced by "El Centro" accelerations by a factor 2 and that they dissipate 50\% of the energy transmitted to the structure.

  abstract = {Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are good candidates for solid-state dampers appropriate for the oscillations of bridge stay cables because of their large recoverable strain, hysteresis and reasonable fatigue-life. This work experimentally analyzes the relevant properties of NiTi SMA and conducts facility measurements, frequency analyzes and simulations of the effects of SMA on stay cables. Appropriate phenomenological SMA models were developed and included in a Finite Element (FE) simulation environment. A complete damping solution for bridge stay cables was developed from these experimental analyzes. This paper detail the required properties for a NiTi SMA and analyzes their performance. For instance, the fatigue-life and several of the thermo-mechanical effects influencing the application of NiTi SMAs are outlined. The damping effect of the SMA was studied in two facilities. The first series of measurements was performed using cable 1 of the ELSA facility (JRC-EU, Ispra, Italy). The second was completed in two campaigns at IFSTTAR (Bouguenais, near Nantes in France). The numeric analyzes and simulated results were completely coherent with these experiments: the SMA dampers also drastically reduce the maximum oscillation amplitude induced by the simulated action. The frequency evolution of the damped cable was studied using direct calculations on the signals, the windowed Fourier transform and Morlet wavelets. © 2012.},

  abstract = {The transformation and retransformation paths realized at constant stress in wires of NiTi SMAs show a horizontal or ‘‘flat’’ behavior in the hysteretic cycle. After sinusoidal cycling at 0.01 Hz (i.e., training) with a maxi- mal strain of 8 \%, the thicker wires of NiTi SMAs, with a diameter of 2.46 mm, have the stress–strain cycles with one S-shaped behavior. A ‘‘similar’’ change appears by varying the grain sizes in the samples, i.e., from 80 to 20 nm. Furthermore, the local measurements of tempera- ture suggest that cycling induces changes in the transfor- mation mechanisms associated with the evolution from horizontal to S shape. For instance, the associated energy evolves from localized transformation to homogeneous heat production in S-shaped cycles. Thermodynamic analysis establishes a link between heat capacity and the slopes of the coexistence curve in f–x or in r–e via the (qe/ qr)coex. The flat cycles were coherent with the classical latent heat, i.e., dissipation at constant stress. In the S-shaped cycles, the heat during the phase change seems redistributed as heat capacity against progressive stress. Preliminary direct measurements are coherent with the evolution of the (qe/qr)coex against strain.},

  abstract = {Many macroscopic behaviors of the martensitic transformations are difficult to explain in the frame of the classical first-order phase transformations, without includ- ing the role of point and crystallographic defects (dislo- cations, stacking faults, interfaces, precipitates). A few major examples are outlined in the present study. First, the elementary reason for thermoelasticity and pseudoelasticity in single crystals of Cu–Zn–Al (b-18R transformation) arises from the interaction of a growing martensite plate with the existing dislocations in the material. Secondly, in Cu–Al–Ni, the twinned hexagonal (c0) martensite produces dislocations inhibiting this transformation and favoring the appearance of 18R in subsequent transformation cycles. Thirdly, single crystals of Cu–Al–Be visualize, via enhanced stress, a transformation primarily to 18R, a structural distortion of the 18R structure, and an additional transformation to another martensitic phase (i.e., 6R) with an increased strain. A dynamic behavior in Ni–Ti is also analyzed, where defects alter the pseudoelastic behavior after cycling. Keywords},

At higher temperature phase or at lower stress the austenite is the metastable phase. The martensite appears at lower temperature phase or higher stresses. The hysteresis of the transformation permits different levels of applications, i.e., in their use as a damper. Two types of applications can be considered in damping of structures in Civil Engineering. The first one is related to diminishing the damage induced by earthquakes. The second one is a reduction of oscillation amplitude associate to an increase of the lifetime for the stayed cables in bridges.

However, they do not give information on the actual path of the atomic displacements during the martensitic transformation. An atomistic model which attempts to do that and results in the same crystallography as in the phenomenological models has previously been described for the transformation from the bcc to the fcc structure by one of the authors. In this model the main shear occurs on the bcc (110)β {$<$}11̄0{$>$}β plane, to which a shuffle on an inclined plane is added. Because both steps could never be separated experimentally, the model remained speculative. It has now been possible to show that an intermediate structure which consists only of shears on (110)β {$<$}11̄0{$>$}β can be obtained by the dezincification of β phase Cu–Zn alloys in the form of coherent spherical particles with the 4H structure. Its appearance proves that this structure has a sufficiently low free energy to serve also as the first step in the martensitic transformation, in which its energy can be decreased further by the shuffles.},

For low evaporation temperatures (450°C) and short dezincification times (around 14 min) the phase transformation is observed solely close to the sample surface. Two phases are formed during this process: the fcc phase, expected at lower Zn concentration, and a metastable phase with an approximately hexagonal structure, which is not expected in principle. Previous transmission electron microscopy studies have reported that this hexagonal structure has a 4H stacking sequence and that the precipitates contain a high density of stacking faults. In this paper the formation of hexagonal precipitates is studied with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It is shown that the precipitates do not have a homogeneous structure. Different regions present different stacking sequences, which on the average result in a diffraction pattern corresponding to a 4H structure. The interface with the matrix appears as a relatively extended region. The results indicate that the ? phase transforms to a hexagonal structure by a simple shuffle mechanism, a result not previously observed.

The results indicate that the ? phase transforms to a hexagonal structure by a simple shuffle mechanism, a result not previously observed. All results can be understood as a consequence of the collapse of the high vibrational entropy due to the large amplitude soft mode \{110\} ?110? vibrations of the ? phase.},

The transformation temperature (470 °C) was close to the minimum temperature at which the transformation could be detected in previous works. The reason for choosing this temperature was that in this way the transformation proceeds sufficiently slowly, making it possible to observe clearly the nucleation stage and the growing process at the surface of the sample. The progress of the dezincification experiment was recorded as a function of time allowing to follow the growing process of fcc needles. The experiments indicated that the formation of the fcc precipitates takes place by a heterogeneous mechanism. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Experimental results show that MCo co-milled 50 h plus admixed MWCNTs for 5 h exhibits enhanced absorption/desorption performance, which remains stable after 15 hydrogen sorption cycles. About 6.5 wt\% of hydrogen was absorbed after 100 s and desorbed in 85 min at 250 °C, being one of the best conditions reported for Mg-based composites. Furthermore, desorption temperature after cycling was reduced by 55 °C due to the introduction of Co, and 136 °C by the combined Co and MWCNT addition as compared to free MgH2. Activation energy analysis demonstrates that although the MWCNT addition has a slight influence on the energy barrier, the Co particles show a good catalytic effect. Moreover, the coupled effect of Co and MWCNTs reduces the activation energy and it is maintained after cycling. As a consequence of cycling, some nanograins of MgH2appear covered with a thin external layer of amorphous carbon while some part of the MWCNTs remains intact in the material. An interpretation of the kinetics effect of Co particles and MWCNT coupled addition is proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Kinetic properties of the reaction with hydrogen of the 2MgH2-Co and 3MgH2-Co mixtures after RMM were evaluated using modified Sieverts-type equipment. The 3MgH2-Co mixture showed better properties for storage applications, with its highest rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption at 300 °C, its storage capacity of about 3.7 wt\% in less than 100 s, and good stability after cycling. Although the starting material presents Mg2CoH5as majority phase, the cycling leads to disproportion between Mg and Co.

The effects of the alloy composition, the nanowire diameter and the grain size on the hysteresis properties are considered. X-ray diffraction indicates that the nanowires are single phase, a fcc Co-Pd solid solution; electron microscopy results show that they are polycrystalline, with randomly oriented grains (7-12 nm), smaller than the wire diameter. Nanowire arrays are ferromagnetic, with an easy magnetization axis parallel to the nanowire long axis. Both, the coercive field and the loop squareness monotonously increase with the Co content and with the grain size, but no clear correlation with the wire diameter is found. The Co and Co-rich nanowire arrays exhibit coercive fields and reduced remanence values quite insensitive to temperature in the range 4 K-300 K; on the contrary, in Pd-rich nanowires both magnitudes are smaller and they largely increase during cooling below 100 K. These behaviors are systematized by considering the strong dependences displayed by the magneto-crystalline anisotropy and the saturation magnetostriction on composition and temperature. At low temperatures the effective anisotropy value and the domain-wall width to grain size ratio drastically change, promoting less cooperative and harder nucleation modes.},

  abstract = {Martensitic transitions involve changes in structure which can be induced thermally as well as under applied mechanical stresses. The thermomechanicalcharacteristics of these displacive transitions are strongly affected by defects which may be introduced in the material by thermomechanical treatments as well as by the transformation itself. To better study the effects of surface defects on these phase transitions high resolution equipment is needed to follow the movement of interfaces. In this work a developed stage is presented. It allows to perform in situ mechanical tests under well controlled temperature conditions and to thermally cycle a sample under controlled stress or strain level in a scanning electron microscope (Philips 515) with small chamber. The test temperature can be easily chosen in the range from −30 to 80 °C. The stage is suitable to be used in bigger chambers of similar equipment. Thermal cycles are obtained using a Peltier thermobattery. The load and deformation are monitored by a load cell and a linear variable differential transformer, respectively. Due to the small space available in the chamber a special port was developed. This port enables the transmission of the mechanical movement generated outside the chamber, the passage of electrical signals, and other commands. Preliminary results of the stage performance obtained with Cu–Zn–Al single crystals are shown.},

  abstract = {Pseudoelastic cycling of Cu-Zn-Al single crystals has been shown to induce microstructural changes in the material. The mechanical response is also altered. However, some of the observed changes in the mechanical behavior are at least partially recovered at temperatures at which point defects are mobile. In this work results are presented in order to analyze the different contributions associated to the changes of the mechanical behavior during pseudoelastic cycling and in a subsequent ageing stage in the β-phase condition for Cu-Zn-Al single crystals. The magnitudes and kinetics of the recoverable changes are analyzed and compared with the other known phenomena that take place at these temperatures, i.e. the martensite stabilization and the beta phase recovery. Results show that the evolution is not simply related to these phenomena. Additional contributions, like point defects generation during cycling and the effect of dislocation array on the beta phase recovery, need to be considered.},

  abstract = {Experiments have been performed in Cu-Zn-Al single crystals in order to further understand the evolution of material properties after continuous pseudoelastic cycling. In a fatigue experiment of this type, permanent and recoverable effects are observed for temperatures above 273 K. Experiments in the stress-strain-time space have been designed in order to separate both contributions. The occurrence of recoverable changes can be related to the ordering of the beta-phase and to the stabilization of the martensite, both depending in turn on the atomic diffusion phenomena in these alloys above 273 K. The kinetics of these processes show a considerable increase of the associated time constant after the pseudoelastic cycling procedure. The relation of these changes with the microstructural evolution of the material is analyzed and a discussion is offered on the role that each mechanism, either diffusive or due to microstructural changes, plays on fatigue. The relevance of defining a reference state in order to determine the consequences of pseudoelastic cycling is shown. A model which considers the stabilization of martensite and the beta recovery has been used to reproduce the stress deformation behavior after cycling. An enhancement of stabilization kinetics during fatigue has allowed us to obtain a closer fit with the experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Strain-controlled experiments were performed using incremental strain steps and different constant maximum strains. Pull-pull cycling results in decreasing/increasing plateau stresses characterizing the forward/reverse transformations and an accumulation of non-recoverable strain. Saturation is reached after 30 cycles. We interpret our results in terms of a microstructural scenario where dislocations, which are introduced during the martensitic transformation (lattice invariant shear) and during pull-pull cycling (dislocation plasticity), interact with the stress-induced formation of martensite. We show that the slopes of stress-strain curves naturally depend on the total strain imposed in strain-controlled testing. We also provide a dislocation-based explanation for the evolving stress levels of the loading and unloading plateaus during pseudoelastic cycling. And most importantly, we show how dislocations act as microstructural markers which allow the material to remember its previous stress-strain history.},

Experiments indicate that the short fiber reinforced material creeps with a stress exponent of 10 while the matrix stress exponent is 5. Procedures published in the literature which yield natural stress exponents and threshold stresses which decrease with increasing temperature were reproduced; however, threshold values corresponding to natural stress exponents cannot be physically justified. The procedures considered in this paper yielded no precise results. Several combinations of stress exponents/threshold values and activation energies are shown to satisfy the procedural requirements. Therefore load transfer and threshold approaches should always be combined with microstructural investigations before an attempt is made to rationalize creep behavior of MMCs. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {It is well known how the features of a stress-strain hysteresis during pseudoelastic pull-pull cycling of NiTi evolve: plateau stresses for the forward (loading) and reverse transformation (unloading) decrease, the width of the stress-strain hysteresis decreases and irreversible strain accumulates. This evolution is strong during early cycling. It is generally assumed that these effects, which saturate after about a hundred cycles, are associated with the elementary processes which govern dislocation plasticity and stress-induced martensitic transformations. Dislocations can do both, stabilize martensite (through their stress fields) and contribute to accumulation of irreversible strain. While it is accepted that dislocations may alter the cyclic stress-strain behavior during stress-induced martensitic transformations in NiTi, it is generally assumed that atomic reordering processes (which are known to significantly affect martensitic transformations in Cu-base shape memory alloys) play no role. In the present investigation we show that hold times in saturated stress-strain cycles show significant effects which are smaller than, but similar in type to those in Cu-base alloys.

The addition of a third element like Pd, Pt or Hf increases the transformation temperature. It is already reported that the substitution of Pd for Ni can increase the transformation temperatures of Ti-Ni from approximately room temperature to 800 K [7]. The phase transformation characteristics within the Ti-Ni-Pd system were recently investigated by combinatorial materials science methods [8]. For the first time the complete composition region showing a reversible phase transformation was determined. For non-transforming compositions, e.g. Ti64Ni20Pd16, X-ray diffraction results showed pronounced amounts of Ti2Pd and Ti2Ni precipitates. However the mechanism of how the precipitates might hinder the phase transformation could not be deduced. Therefore a TEM sample of Ti64Ni20Pd16 was cut form the Ti-Ni-Pd composition spread by target preparation methods using a focused ion beam (FIB) system with attached energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.},

In this work, the effects produced by swift heavy ions on the martensitic 18R structure of Cu-Zn-Al alloy (Cu - 12.17 Zn - 17.92 Al, in \%at) were analyzed.

  abstract = {The effects of irradiation with swift heavy ions on L21long range ordered β phase Cu-Zn-Al single crystals with surface orientation close to (0 0 1)βwere investigated. The resulting change in structure and microstructure were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. A phase transformation to a close-packed phase, loops and cavities were observed and characterized after the irradiation process. The origin and the stability of the microstructural changes due to irradiation are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The irradiation effects of thinning a sample of a Cu-Zn-Al shape memory alloy to electron transparency by a Ga(+) focused ion beam were investigated. This thinning method was compared with conventional electropolishing and Ar(+) ion milling. No implanted Ga was detected but surface FCC precipitation was found as a result of the focused ion beam sample preparation. Decreasing the irradiation dose by lowering the energy and current of the Ga(+) ions did not lead to a complete disappearance of the FCC structure. The latter could only be removed after gentle Ar(+) ion milling of the sample. It was further concluded that the precipitation of the FCC is independent of the crystallographic orientation of the surface.},

  abstract = {The effects produced by swift heavy ions in the martensitic (18R) and austenitic phase (beta) of Cu based shape memory alloys were characterized. Single crystal samples with a surface normal close to [210](18R) and [001](beta) were irradiated with 200 MeV of Kr(15+), 230 MeV of Xe(15+), 350 and 600 MeV of Au(26+) and Au(29+). Changes in the microstructure were studied with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was found that swift heavy ion irradiation induced nanometer sized defects in the 18R martensitic phase. In contrast, a hexagonal close-packed phase formed on the irradiated surface of beta phase samples. HRTEM images of the nanometer sized defects observed in the 18R martensitic phase were compared with computer simulated images in order to interpret the origin of the observed contrast. The best agreement was obtained when the defects were assumed to consist of local composition modulations.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for determining the quantity of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4, SPIONs) embedded in animal tissue using magnetization measurements. With this method, the smallest detectable quantity of magnetite nanoparticles in a tissue sample is -1 microg. We showed that this method has proved being efficient. In this study, we focused in determining the quantity of SPION confined in lung and liver tissue of mice injected with -13 nm magnetite superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, the method allowed us to detect the magnetite nanoparticles present in animal tissues without letting the natural iron ions present in the tissue or blood interfere with the measurements.},

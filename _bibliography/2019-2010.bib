  abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures comprising Au and ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by the spontaneous reduction of HAuCl4 in ethylene glycol were used to assess the possibility of modulating the direction of the electron transfer processes at the interface. One electron UV reduction and visible oxidation of the reversible couple TEMPOL/TEMPOL-H was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. The apparent quantum yield for TEMPOL-H conversion under continuous wave visible excitation depends on the irradiation wavelength, being 0.57\% and 0.27\% at 450 +/- 12 and 530 +/- 12 nm, respectively. These results indicate that both the surface plasmon resonance and the interband transition from the 5d to the 6s level of Au nanoparticles contribute to the visible activity of the nanostructure. In addition, by detecting free electron conduction band electrons in ZnO, after the visible excitation of Au/ZnO nanostructures, we provide direct evidence of the photoexcited electron transfer from gold nanoparticles to ZnO.},

Pseudoelastic cycling was studied after thermal ageing; mechanical behaviour evolved on cycling and a repetitive behaviour was obtained after a small number of cycles. Changes in microstructure were analysed in the β phase by transmission electron microscopy which allowed observing the morphology and distribution of γ precipitates.

The coatings were obtained at high current pulse frequency and show high microhardness and absence of brittleness. The surface of the coating consists of nanometer sized crystals forming a cauliflower-like structure protected by a mixture of nickel and tungsten oxides. The cauliflower structure is preserved into the bulk coating that exhibits an average composition ≈70 at\% Ni30 at\% W. Different phases are observed in the bulk structure: a W-rich amorphous phase (≈40\%) and Ni-rich crystalline phases (≈60\%). The crystalline phases consist of crystalline domains ≈7 nm in size of Ni(W) (fcc) solid solution (12 at\% W content) and a minor Ni4W component (less than 10\%). The amorphous phase exhibits a less compact NiW structure where some amount of C could also be present. Oxidized W species cannot be detected in the bulk coating, thus discarding the presence of significant amounts of tungsten carbide, tungstates or citrate-tungsten complexes. Our results shed light on controversial points related to the chemical composition and demonstrate the complex structure of this system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles Pt/C (NPs) are used in many fields of science. These kinds of materials have been extensively studied in electrochemistry due to the fact that they are applied in fuel cell technology. Although there are a myriad of methods for Pt NP synthesis, the need for obtaining Pt/C NPs with a good dispersion (covering over the entire support), a narrow size distribution, and clean surface (among other parameters) is far to be overcome. On this sense herein we describe a very easy and quick method of synthesis of highly dispersed Pt NPs followed by a simple electrochemical cleaning step. The catalysts were electrochemically characterized by studying their behavior in 0.5 M H2SO4 and also by using CO as a probe during the CO electro-oxidation reaction (COEOR). This paper shows how to obtain highly dispersed and clean Pt/C NPs that produce very reproducible results. Besides, we demonstrate how the presence of impurities negatively affects the electrochemical reproducibility of Pt NPs with a clear impact on their catalytic activity.

  abstract = {In this work, it is shown that thiol-protected Au nanoparticles (AuNPs@SR) of approximately 3.4 nm size suffered unexpectedly high radiation damage under standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operating conditions. For metallic systems (conducting sample), it is expected that the greatest contribution to the damage comes from knock-on displacement, but radiolysis is the most probable radiation damage mechanism for organic samples. The radiation damage of the electron beam produces huge changes in AuNPs’ structure, leading to coalescence of the Au cores when their \{100\} surfaces are facing each other. The complete coalescence process involve thiol desoprtion, AuNPs’ reorientation, and surface diffusion of Au adatoms, which produce the oriented attachment of the Au cores. The knock-on displacement cannot explain by itself the time taken by the entire process. Through a rigorous analysis, we rationalize the results considering that because of the small size of AuNPs they have a lower electron density than the bulk material which favors radiolytic damage.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of thiomalic acid (TMA) on Au(111) and on preformed Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) protected by weak ligands has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical techniques. Results show that TMA is adsorbed on the Au(111) surface as thiolate species with a small amount of atomic sulfur (∼10\%) and a surface coverage lower than that found for alkanethiols due to steric factors. The amount of atomic sulfur markedly increases when the TMA is adsorbed on AuNPs by the ligand exchange method. We propose that the atomic sulfur is produced as a consequence of C−S bond cleavage, a process that is more favorable at defective sites of the AuNPs surface. The bond scission is also assisted by the presence of the electron-withdrawing carboxy moiety in the α- position relative to the C−S bond. Moreover, the high local concentration of positively charged species increases the stability of the negatively charged leaving group, leading to a higher amount of coadsorbed atomic sulfur. Our results demonstrate that the terminal functionalities of thiols are conditioning factors in the final structure and composition of the adlayers. ■},

  abstract = {Bulk Al-Al2O3metal matrix composites (MMCs) named HITEMAL (high temperature aluminum) were fabricated in situ by forging compaction of five different types of gas-atomized commercial purity Al powders with a mean particle size in the range of 1-9μm. As-forged HITEMAL consisted of (sub)micrometric Al grains (matrix) decorated with nanometric thick amorphous Al2O3(a-Al2O3) skeleton. Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) free of Al2O3were located in the Al grain interior. The Al grain size and the portion of LAGBs increased with the increase in the relative powder surface area. As-forged HITEMAL shows excellent thermal stability up to 400°C for 24h. Annealing at temperatures ≥450°C led to crystallization and morphological transformation from a-Al2O3skeleton to nanometric γ-Al2O3particles. Owing to the pinning effect of Al2O3phase, no Al grain growth took place during annealing up to 500°C. HITEMAL showed attractive mechanical properties especially when tested at 300°C (yield strength up to 220MPa, Young's modulus up to 58GPa). Despite the presence of a nearly continuous a-Al2O3skeleton along adjacent Al grains, forged HITEMAL materials had reasonable room temperature elongation of 7-26\%. HITEMAL's elongation decreased as the Al grain size decreased and with increased testing temperature. The loss in elongation (uniform and total) was attributed to the inhomogeneous flow, which occurred due to high densities of high angle grain boundaries (dislocation sinks) and small content of LAGBs. The strength of HITEMAL stemmed from grain boundary mediated strengthening mechanisms. The results showed a positive deviation from the Hall-Petch plot, which is typical behavior of ultrafine-grained metals. Transformation of a-Al2O3skeleton to γ-Al2O3particles led to deterioration of the HITEMAL strength and Young's modulus. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In the present work, J-resistance curves of Inconel 690 and Incoloy 800 nuclear steam generator tubes with circumferential and longitudinal through wall cracks were obtained at room temperature and 300 °C using recently developed non-standard specimens' geometries. It was found that Incoloy 800 tubes exhibited higher J-resistance curves than Inconel 690 for both crack orientations. For both materials, circumferential cracks resulted into higher fracture resistance than longitudinal cracks, indicating a certain degree of texture anisotropy introduced by the tube fabrication process. From a practical point of view, temperature effects have found to be negligible in all cases. The results obtained in the present work provide a general framework for further application to structural integrity assessments of cracked tubes in a variety of nuclear steam generator designs.},

With that purpose, different studies available in the literature dealing with the experimental determination of fracture toughness of SGT materials were firstly reviewed.

  abstract = {The assessment of the structural integrity of steam generator (SG) tubes in nuclear power plants deserved increasing attention in the last years due to the negative impact related to their failures. In this context, elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) methodology appears as a potential tool for the analysis. The application of EPFM requires, necessarily, knowledge of two aspects, i.e., the driving force estimation in terms of an elastic plastic toughness parameter (e.g., J) and the experimental measurement of the fracture toughness of the material (e.g., the material J-resistance curve). The present work describes the development of a non standardized experimental technique aimed to determine J-resistance curves for SG tubes with circumferential through wall cracks (TWCs). The tubes were made of Incoloy 800 (Ni: 30.0-35.0; Cr: 19.0-23.0; Fe: 35.5min, \% in weight). Due to its austenitic microstructure, this alloy shows very high toughness and is widely used in applications where a good corrosion resistance in aqueous environment or an excellent oxidation resistance in high temperature environment is required.},

They have been found susceptible to diverse degradation mechanisms during service. Due to the significance of a SGT failure on the plant safe operation, nuclear regulatory authorities have established tube plugging or repairing criteria which are based on the defect depth. The widespreadly used "40\% criterion" proposed in the 70s is an example whose use is still recommended in the last editions of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. In the present work, an alternative, more realistic and less conservative methodology for SGT integrity evaluation is proposed. It is based on the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) and takes advantage of the recent developments in non-destructive techniques which allow a more comprehensive characterization of tube defects, i.e., depth, length, orientation and type. The proposed approach has been applied to: the study of the influence of primary and secondary stresses on tube integrity; the prediction of failure mode (i.e., ductile fracture or plastic collapse) of defective SGTs for varied crack geometries and loading conditions; the analysis of the sensibility of tensile and fracture properties with temperature. The potentiality of the FAD as a comprehensive methodology for predicting the failure loads and failure modes of flawed SGTs is highlighted.},

This paper reports an analysis of the systematics of cohesive properties and equation-of-state parameters for a large number of stable, metastable and hypothetical binary Me a X b  type phases formed by Me~=~Cu, Ni with X~=~In, Sn. To this aim, an ab initio database previously developed by the authors using spin polarized density-functional-theory calculations, using the VASP code, is adopted. The work involves the volume (V 0 ), Wigner–Seitz radius, bulk modulus (B 0 ) and cohesive energy (E coh ) of the phases. At the outset of the paper it is shown that these properties can be studied as functions of the average group number (AGN), i.e., the weighted average of the number of valence electrons involved in the VASP calculations. Moreover, the cohesive energy density (CED), defined as E coh /V 0 , is shown to correlate very well with the AGN variable and with B 0 . These striking regularities are given two complementary interpretations. First, a general microscopic picture of the variations of cohesion is developed by studying the evolution of the contributions of the d- and p-electrons to their electronic density of states. In this way the effects of the hybridization of d- and p-electrons, and the filling up of bonding and anti-bonding states is highlighted. Next, a thermodynamic analysis based on the classical approach developed by Rose, Ferrante, Smith and collaborators is performed. It is concluded that the correlation involving CED and B 0  is a manifestation of a significant degree of “universality” in the variation of the cohesive properties with the Wigner–Seitz radius of these compounds.},

Some properties (entropy, temperature, specific heat) of the nanocrystal are calculated numerically but exactly within the framework of the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the presence of a surface in the nanocrystal modifies the thermostatistic properties to a greater extent than the small number of atoms in the system. The specific heat Cv behaves similarly to the Einstein solid, with an asymptotic value for high temperatures that differs from that of the Dulong-Petit law by a term of the order of NA\textasciicircum (-1/3) and that can be explained easily in terms of the surface. The entropy is non-additive, but this is due to the presence of the surface and we show that the additivity is recovered in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we find that, when calculations follow the canonical ensemble, results differ little for small systems (NA = 27) and are inexistent for larger systems (NA = 1000).},

Using this model, and “universal” values for the function and its first and second derivatives at the equilibrium distance (z=0), three general interrelations between EOS parameters and the cohesive energy are obtained. The first correlation involves the bulk modulus, and the second, the thermal expansion coefficient. In order to test these results an extensive database is developed, which involves available experimental data, and results of current ab initio density-functional-theory calculations using the VASP code. In particular, the 0~K values for volume, bulk modulus, its pressure derivative, and the cohesive energy of 27 elements belonging to the first (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), second (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd) and third (Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au) transition row of the Periodic Table are calculated ab initio and used to test the present results. The third correlation obtained, allows an evaluation of the third derivative of F(z) at z=0 for the current elements. With this new information, a discussion is presented of the possibility of finding a “universal” F(z) versus z function able to account accurately for the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus of the transition elements.},

The samples studied are polycrystalline columnar grains of 11–38\,nm average diameter, and different textures. The focus is on deformation mechanisms in the crack tip region and the influence of texture, grain size and temperature on the fracture propagation. We found that the [1–100] texture is the most brittle with deformation at the crack tip occurring only through twinning with almost no dislocation activity. The more ductile textures are those where dislocation mechanisms are activated. For the basal orientation we observed {$<$}a{$>$} dislocations while {$<$}c\,+\,a{$>$} dislocations are dominant for the [11–20] texture. One important observation is that crack propagation can be hindered by the presence of the grain boundaries. As a result, samples with the smallest grain sizes are the more resistant to crack propagation. As expected, higher temperatures imply easier deformation, resulting in more ductile behavior for all orientations. At room temperature and higher, crack propagation occurs mostly intra granularly. However, at 77\,K the [1–100] textured sample shows crack propagation through the nucleation of micro-voids ahead of the main crack.},

The analysis was performed on well-oriented CuZnAl single crystalline shape-memory alloys subjected to uniaxial tensile loadings, combining direct strain measurements determined with an extensometer and the four-lead electrical resistance technique. In that way the relationship between strain and electrical resistance could be evaluated by formulating a physics based model that can be easily contrasted with the experimental characterization of a simple benchmark system. It was found that the model here developed provides general guidelines for the selection of a shape-memory material for positioning actuators and that the correlation between strain and electrical resistance is of rather limited precision, even for the simplest material case and loading condition analyzed. The effects of temperature, deformation rate, temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of austenite and martensite phases and temperature dependence of the strain associated with the stress induced transformation were carefully characterized. Results suggest that the direct use of feedback from electrical resistance measurements for precise positioning is arguable unless materials with low hysteresis and low latent heat of transformation are used in combination with quasi-static operating conditions.},

We synthesized Ni(II) dodecanethiolate (C12S) (without the addition of NaBH4) for comparison and performed an exhaustive characterization with TEM, HR-TEM, AFM, MFM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis, magnetism, and FT-IR. It is found that the organic coating is not quite a well-organized self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surrounding the Ni cluster as previously reported.(2, 3) XPS and XRD data show slight differences between both syntheses; however, Ni(II) thiolate appears to be more stable than reduced Ni when exposed to ambient air, indicating the propensity of metallic Ni to oxidize. It has been shown that irradiating with TEM electrons over various metal thiolates leads to nanoparticle formation.(4) We irradiated over Ni(II) thiolate and observed no evidence of NP formation whereas irradiating a reduced Ni sample exhibited an ∼3.0 nm nanoparticle diameter. Magnetism studies showed a difference between both samples, indicating ferromagnetic character for the reduced Ni sample. According to our results, the product of the synthesis is comprised of ultrasmall metallic clusters embedded in some form of Ni(II) C 12S. In this work, we open a discussion of the chemical nature of the core and the shell in the synthesis of Ni NPs protected with organomercaptan molecules. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

With this modification we were able to obtain small particle sizes with a good control in size distribution. The Fe-Urea complex is easy to prepare with excellent yields. Core–shell nanoparticles are then prepared using palladium(ii) acetylacetonate as a Pd source, to obtain a Pd0 shell stabilised by oleylamine. The core–shell superparamagnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4@Pd-OA are extensively characterized by FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis, thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry, and magnetic susceptibility measurements, and tested in a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling Suzuki–Miyaura reaction with promising results.}

The supports were obtained through two different synthesis methods: co-precipitation (PI) and mechanochemical reaction (MR). Characterization of the catalysts, before and after ESR, were performed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), nitrogen physisorption, CO chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), thermogravimetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The Ru (2wt.\%) PI catalyst exhibited the highest activity and selectivity to hydrogen and no coke deposition was observed during catalytic operation, even when compared to Ni (8wt.\%) PI catalyst. A possible reaction pathway is proposed. The remarkably good catalytic performance of Ru (2wt.\%) PI is regarded as being due to a combination of factors: improved metal dispersion on Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, favorable metal-support interaction and water gas shift reaction promotion.},

In this work, a new synthesis route, avoiding the use of solvents, high temperatures and dangerous sub-products, is used to obtain cubic and monoclinic Li2TiO3 nanopowders. This method consists of ball milling of LiCl, TiO2 and NaOH in air atmosphere at room temperature and posterior calcination. Structural, microstructural and textural characteristics of the Li2TiO3 powders as well as of the pellets before and after annealing were determined. Remarkable contraction of the material and high mechanical stability was observed after treatment at 800 °C for 5 h. Finally, the behaviour in reductive and inert atmospheres of the sintered and green pellets was studied, characterizing the extension and impact of the reactions on the physicochemical and structural stability of the material. It can be concluded that the sintered pellets became mechanically stable due to the thermal treatment, showing no physicochemical modifications after analysis in different atmospheres up to 800 °C.},

Thus, this work introduces an innovative method for assessing stress–strain properties at a sub-millimeter scale and illustrates the potential of the technique by evaluating the strength of a sub- region in the HAZ from welded steels pipes. The method employs a fully instrumented stage inside a scanning electron microscope that stretches small tensile specimens (2.0 mm · 0.5 mm cross-section, 12.5 mm gage length) while registering detailed images of the deformed region. The specimens, cut from full-scale welds, include in their gage length weld metal, base metal and HAZ and have an 85 lm period grid of evaporated lead on their surface to visualise the deformation. Upon straining, local strain is determined by correlating sequential images of the specimen surface with an open source code for particle image velocimetry. The calculated local strain within the HAZ and the load values recorded during testing are converted into a local stress–strain response. The results for two different heat inputs agree with usual, but indirect and less accurate assessments procedures, including local hardness measurements and notched bar testing. KEY},

Fracture tests were performed inside the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using small specimens, allowing the direct measurement of the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) on the surface. CTODs of approximately half a millimeter were attained for crack growth of about onetenth of a millimeter before the crack crossed the fusion line. Three methods for computing the CTOD were compared, and the differences among the results were discussed. Furthermore, the surface strain field, calculated by measuring the distortion of a regular grid, showed evidence of an influence of HAZ inhomogeneity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results obtained indicate that the hardness response is faster and the peak hardness is higher when plastic deformation and micro-alloying are applied together than performing each procedure individually. Different amounts of deformation, ranging from 0\% to 30\% have been utilized. An optimum deformation degree for the hardening response has been established around 8\% for the Al-Cu-Si-Ge alloy. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the peak hardness is due to a complex microstructure that contained  disc shaped precipitates, rod-shaped Si-Ge precipitates and  plates that were heterogeneously nucleated on the Si-Ge particles. Pre-deformation has been found to stimulate the growth of the  plates due to enhanced diffusion along dislocation cores. Increasing deformation reduces the influence of the Si-Ge precipitates on heterogeneous nucleation, leading to reduced peak hardness and faster over-ageing.},

Several glycine-to-nitrates molar ratios were investigated. A detailed morphological and structural characterization was performed, employing X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, and electron microscopy (scanning and transmission). The as-synthesized LSCM nanopowders consist of interconnected nanoparticles forming a sponge-like structure with typical meso- and macropores. For glycineto- nitrates molar ratios above stoichiometric molar ratio, a high proportion of well-crystallized LSCM phase was obtained. An increase of glycine content in the initial synthesis gel, decreases the average nanoparticles size from ̃20 to ̃6 nm, narrows the distribution crystallite size, and increases the specific surface area of the LSCM nanopowders from ̃14 to ̃30 m 2/g. The evolution of crystalline phases of the as-synthesized LSCM nanopowders after calcination at various temperatures was studied: pure-phase La 0.75Sr 0.25Cr 0.5Mn 0.5O 3-δ perovskites with particlesize distribution between 100 and 300 nm, have been obtained after calcination at 1,000 °C for 6 h.

  abstract = {Pure-phase La0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ(LSCF) nanocrystallites were successfully synthesized by the combustion method, by employing glycine as fuel and complexing agent, and ammonium nitrate as combustion trigger. The morphological and structural characterization of the LSCF nanopowders was performed by using X-ray diffraction, N2physisorption and electron microscopy. The LSCF nanopowder consists of interconnected nanocrystallites (∼45 nm) forming a sponge-like structure with meso and macropores, being its specific surface area around 10 m2g-1. Crystalline structural analyses show that the LSCF nanopowder presents cubic symmetry in the Pm-3m space group. By employing the spin coating technique and different thermal treatments, symmetrical cells with different electrode crystallite size (45 and 685 nm) were built, by using La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δas electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed varying temperature and pO2. The area specific resistance of the nanostructured sample (45 nm) decreases by two orders of magnitude with respect to the submicrostructured sample (685 nm), reaching values as low as 0.8 Ω cm2at 450 °C. This improvement is attributed to the cathode morphology optimization in the nanoscale, i.e., enlargement of the exposed surface area and shortening of the oxygen diffusion paths, which reduce the polarization resistance associated to the surface exchange and O-ion bulk diffusion process. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

After 10 years since the first study on this kind of Pd nanoparticles was published, the surface composition of the particles is a matter of debate in the literature and it has not been unambiguously assessed. The nanoparticles were studied by means of several techniques: UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimental data, obtained for the 3 nm diameter Pd particles, prepared by both synthetic routes, are consistent with nanoparticles composed by Pd(0) cores surrounded by a submonolayer of sulfide species, which are protected by alkanethiolates. Also, we unambiguously demonstrate that the chemical nature of these particles is very similar to that experimentally found for alkanethiolate-modified bulk Pd. The results from this paper are important not only for handling thiolate-protected Pd nanoparticles in catalysis and sensing, but also for the basic comprehension of metallic nanoparticles and the relation of their surface structure with the synthesis method. -� 2012 American Chemical Society},

We generated nanoparticles of different shapes (sphere, icosahedron, octahedron, cuboctahedron) and compared the resulting P-C isotherms with the bulk and a few available experimental results. Instead of the plateau corresponding to the α-β PdH equilibrium in the bulk, the nanoparticles isotherms show at least a two-plateaux behavior, corresponding to a subsurface hydride formation and a subsequent filling of the core of the nano-particle with H atoms. We also studied the evolution of the atomic pressure profiles inside nanoparticles. We used different criteria to define the atomic volumes at the surfaces and calculated the atomic stresses. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The influence of natural aging on precipitation hardening of an Al-Mg-Si alloy was investigated by mechanical testing and quantitative transmission electron microscopy. It was found that natural aging increases yield stress and reduces ductility, which is attributed to the formation of Mg/Si clusters. The evolution of tensile properties saturates after around 7 days natural aging. Artificial aging for 30. min at 180°C after solution treatment resulted in an important increase in yield strength and loss of ductility, due to the rapid precipitation of the β'' intermediate phase. Previous natural aging progressively reduces the strengthening effect of 30. min/180°C artificial aging, completely suppressing it after 7 days pre-aging. Microhardness evolution during 180°C artificial aging was followed in samples that were aged immediately after quenching, and with 7 days natural aging before artificial aging. In addition, microstructural characterization using TEM was carried out at specific artificial aging times. Previous natural aging was found to reduce the initial hardening rate, producing a delay in the formation of β'' precipitates. The peak-aging condition was reached almost at the same aging time. However, longer β'' precipitates with a lower volume fraction were observed when artificial aging was preceded by natural aging. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The electrochemical characterization was performed using laboratory equipment. In the first design version an anode and a cathode, both embedded in electrolyte, and electrically isolated by means of a separator, were placed inside a reactor. Based on the identification of problems detected in the structural performance analysis and the electrochemical characterization of the different prototype models, the versatility and usefulness of the designs were optimized. The final prototype design was satisfactorily tested in electrochemical cycling and rate capability studies, with different electrode and separator materials and using different weights between electrodes. The internal pressure monitoring of a sealed cell, under different conditions of use, was also demonstrated, thus proving that the design allows the systematic study of different application requirements. © 2009 Professor T.

The CNE were synthesized by two-stage polymerization of furfuryl alcohol, drying and carbonization, and were subsequently doped with different proportions of Ni (0-20\%) by the method of wet impregnation with Nickel nitrate hexahydrate. The behavior of electrochemical cells consisting of a working electrode with 45\% of MH, 5\% of CNE pure and doped with different proportions of Ni and 50\% carbon Teflon acting as electrical and mechanical support, a counter electrode of Ni mesh, and a reference electrode Hg/HgO was studied. The experiments covered electrochemical activation and cycle stability, rate capability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the addition of CNE improves the electrochemical performance, and particularly the CNEs pure and doped with 20\% of Ni present the best electrochemical performance in discharge capacity, rate capability and impedance spectroscopy. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The work is focused to determine the best procedure to get fast charge and long cycle life without detrimental effects on the battery and possible hazards affecting the safety of the user. The device was studied under a wide range of charge current (0.1-5 C), establishing that optimum conditions to minimize the inner pressure during uninterrupted use are obtained if either charge rates up to 0.5 C or higher rates not surpassing 90\% of the nominal capacity are employed. Charge times corresponding to the range between 80\% and 130\% of the nominal capacity were also tested, analyzing the effect of overcharges on inner pressure, discharge capacity, efficiency and integrity of the cell. It was verified that charging the cell up to 130\% at 2 C rate reaches an inner pressure 5 times higher than that obtained at 0.5 C. High rate discharge was also characterized at uninterrupted use of the cell, demonstrating the importance of the cut-off discharge criterion at high rates, to avoid the inner gases accumulation due to incomplete discharge of electrodes and overcharge in a following electrochemical cycle. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cu-Zn-Al shape-memory alloy single crystals can have two sequential, stress-induced martensitic transitions, depending on their chemical composition and crystallographic orientation: first, the β-18R transition and, as the load increases, the 18R-6R transition. At electronic concentration e/a=1.48, the 18R-6R transition is immediately followed by the plastic deformation of the 6R phase. This phenomenon is usually undesired, as it compromises the reversibility of the pseudoelastic effect. Two different approaches have been applied to counteract the plastic deformation of the 6R phase: 1. A modification of the chemical composition of the alloy, reducing e/a; 2. The controlled introduction of gamma-phase precipitates, which increases the yield stress of the 6R phase. The former approach was relatively successful but, al lower e/a, the kinetics of defect formation and propagation due to pseudoelastic cycling are significantly increased, which renders these alloys unsuitable for most applications. The latter approach, on the other hand, results in 6R without plastic deformation, and does not seem to have a negative impact in the fatigue life of the alloy. However, the authors only studied one specific distribution of precipitates which, despite being successful, may not be the optimal condition to harden the 6R phase and increase pseudoelastic fatigue life. No information is available in the literature regarding the effect of different precipitate sizes on the 18R-6R transformation.},

  abstract = {Mechanical damping applications could benefit from the large hysteresis, large pseudoelastic strain and the fact that the transformation stresses of the 18R↔6R martensite-martensite transformation depend very little on temperature in Cu-based alloys. This work presents the 18R↔6R mechanical cycling behavior of CuZnAl shape-memory alloy single crystals with electronic concentration e/a=1.48. A fine distribution of gamma phase nanoprecipitates is introduced to prevent plastic deformation of the 6R phase. Results show that, although significant 6R stabilization is observed at very low frequencies (below 10-2Hz), it is possible to obtain more than 1000 stable pseudoelastic cycles with only minor changes in transformation stresses and hysteresis width at frequencies above 10-1Hz. A more pronounced decrease in transformation stresses is observed after 1000 cycles. Nevertheless, the decrease in hysteresis is small up to 2000 cycles. Reported and present results indicate that pair interchange of atoms can explain the stabilization of 6R under quasistatic experimental conditions. However, at higher frequencies of cycling, stabilization of this martensite shows additional features, leading to a dynamic stabilization with slight effects on the mechanical behavior at the required frequency and number of cycles. On the whole, the behavior of this transformation is unique and very promising. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, the successive stress induced transformations from the high temperature austenitic DO3 structure (β1) to the 18R and to the 6R martensites were considered. Several distinct features which characterize the stress induced transformations in Cu-Al-Be and distinguish this system from other Cu-based shape-memory alloys are reported in this work. It was found that the 6R phase forms from a distorted 18R and that this stress induced transformation is highly reversible with no plastic deformation accompanying the process. The stress induced transformation from the distorted 18R to the 6R structure exhibits wide hysteresis, comparable with values observed in the NiTi system. A slightly negative temperature dependence of the critical stress to induce the 6R martensite was determined. Finally, a stress-temperature phase transformation diagram involving the metastable β1, 18R and 6R phases is proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {© 2017, ASM International. This work has its roots in a long-term theoretical research line aimed at developing a complete database with structural, thermodynamic, cohesive and elastic properties of the intermetallic compounds (ICs) of the type MeaXbwhere Me~=~Cu, Ni and X~=~In, Sn and Sb. The paper reports the results of an ab initio study of various phases occurring in the Ni-Sb phase diagram, viz., the low-temperature Ni3Sb (orthorhombic oP8), the high-temperature Ni3Sb (cubic cF16), Ni5Sb2(monoclinic mC28), NiSb (hexagonal hP4) and the NiSb2(orthorhombic oP6) compounds. The molar volume, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative, the electronic density of states (DOS) and the energy of formation from the elements of these compounds are calculated ab initio using the relativistic projected augmented wave (PAW) method implemented in the VASP code. The Local Density Approximation of Ceperley and Alder and the Generalized Gradient Approximation due to Perdew and Wang are adopted to treat the exchange and correlation energies. Detailed comparisons between the current and previously reported theoretical and experimental values are reported.},

Here, we report the microstructure of electrodeposition grown Fe-Pd nanowires in which the process was confined to polycarbonate membranes with a nominal pore diameter of 200 nm. We used an acid electrolyte (pH ≈ 5) in which the solution was stabilized with sulfosalicylic acid. The average chemical concentration of the nanowires can be systematically shifted from rich palladium to rich iron by changing the growth potential. The study of the microstructure by transmission electron microscopy indicates high chemical inhomogeneities due to phase coexistence between rich palladium regions (with FCC structure) and rich iron regions. The latter present a combination of BCC and amorphous phases. The average chemical composition of the nanowires can be better adjusted by using a low frequency square wave voltage excitation (alternating rich Pd and rich Fe regions). However, independently of the growth process, the nanowires morphology collapses after thermal annealing. This could be ascribed to fragile grain boundaries due to the presence of amorphous hydroxides and chemical impurities produced during the electrochemical process.},

Under small-scale yielding conditions, the mixed-mode crack growth rates were found to correlate best with √ΔK eff2 II +1.2 ΔK eff2 III in maraging steel, while for Ti-6Al-4V, √ΔK eff2 II +1.2 ΔK eff2 III appeared suitable. For extended plasticity, a crack growth prediction method is proposed and validated for Ti-6Al-4V.

The Cu L2,3 white-lines intensities, which reflect the unoccupied density of states in 3d bands, were measured in situ, during the phase transformation in both the martensite and austenite phases. We find that the white-lines intensity decreases during the inverse transformation, when going from martensite to austenite. Even though the initial 3d occupation numbers in 2H and 18R martensitic structures are different, after the transformation, the 3d occupation numbers in the now austenitic structure have decreased in both samples, indicating that some electrons left Cu 3d bands during phase transformation. Interestingly enough, the occupation numbers in the final phases, which have the same structure, reach the same value, indicating that changes in EELS spectra are a consequence of structural changes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The as-grown films present grains with an average size of 20 nm. The films with thickness of 1 μm have a single metastable phase with a hexagonal structure and are textured with planes (0002) parallel to the plane of the films. It was observed that thicker films present phase coexistence between metastable hexagonal and body centered cubic structures with a gradual increment of the body centered cubic phase fraction. The films with thickness of 5 μm are textured with planes (0002) and 101̄0 in the hexagonal structure, whereas in the body centered cubic structure the films are textured with \{110\} planes parallel to the plane of the films. This fact can be associated with self-heating of the substrate during the growth of the films and with the relative stability of the metastable phases. Free standing films annealed in a second step (1123 K for 1 h) present austenitic phase with L2 structure and sub-micrometric grains textured with \{220\} planes parallel to the plane of the films.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The aim of this paper was to obtain clean NPs, beginning by using "soft" methods, in order to keep unaltered both the NPs size and shape; however, an important surfactant remnant was observed. Consequently, it was performed an electrochemical cleaning through PVP and glycolate electro-oxidation, being accompanied with important perturbations of NPs atoms and dissolution and re-deposition of Pt. Finally, the performance of the catalyst towards the glycerol electro-oxidation reaction (GER), before and after the cleaning process was studied. In addition, we demonstrate how the impurities bring about poor reproducibility in this kind of experiments due to the fact that the cleaning process is occurring at the same time that the GER and because cleaning extent along cycles varies for each independent experiment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These include material in a variety of thermo-mechanical conditions, e. g., cold rolled, stress relieved, recrystallized, welded, biphasic, together with minority second phases belonging to the original material or incorporated due to in-service conditions. The anisotropic crystalline structure of zirconium is exploited in microscopical observations by means of polarizer filters that enhance the contrast between different grains, and greatly aid the identification in most microstructures. Most microstructural variations across a wide range of length-scales, such as those produced by welding processes, can be effectively resolved by traditional optical microscopy (OM). However, some finer microstructures like those found in CANDU1 (CANada Deuterium Uranium) reactor pressure tube material, or some minority second phase particles like the Zr(Fe, Cr)2 precipitates in Zircaloy-4 cannot be completely resolved by this technique. Thus, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are required in such cases. For SEM observations we show the valuable issue of the scale in specific microstructural studies, which allows quantifying microstructural parameters using image analysis. For TEM observations, we have greatly benefited from the electron diffraction diagrams, which have allowed us to investigate the crystalline structure of irradiated second phase particles, which would remain unnoticed to both, OM or SEM observations.}

We show that alkanethiolates and sulfur adsorbed on Pt surfaces are more stable against reductive desorption than these species on Au substrates. Furthermore, for short-chain thiol-capped platinum nanoparticles we observe complete removal of sulfur-containing species. Hence, these results make this procedure suitable for its use in electrocatalysis. As an example, we demonstrate that 2 nm thiomalic acid-protected platinum nanoparticles markedly improve the performance of a hydrogen storage alloy material, with no additional steps in the preparation of the electrodes.},

Graphite catalytic effect is independent of its morphology and is more pronounced when the additive is incorporated from the beginning of milling, as well as in a higher weight proportion.

In addition, the effect of microstructure is studied by using a newsol-gel route which allows obtaining LaBaCo2O6-δ with smallest particle size (dp ≈ 500 nm). The electrode reaction isstudied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of temperature (T) and oxygen partial pressure (pO2). The electrode polarization resistance (RC,P) presents two contributions, a low frequency (RLF) and a high frequency Gerischer-resistance (RG). On one side, RLF, associated to the O2-gas diffusion across the gas layer boundary, presents low activation energy (Ea) and is proportional to pO2−1, presenting the same values regardless the microstructure.On the other side, RG is in agreement with anO2-reduction mechanismco-limited by O-surface exchange and O-bulk diffusion. RG is strongly influenced by structure (trough the diffusion coefficient DV) and microstructure (inversely proportional to dp). Besides, RG decreases by reducing dp and by modifying the La/Ba ordering from layered to randomly distributed.},

Aging thermal treatments made to the β-CuAlNi single crystal phase at 423 K were conducted in order to study how the main properties of these alloys change. Aging of the metastable β-phase above room temperature but well below the eutectoid point can favor a further ordering process started during quenching and trigger the decomposition of part of the alloy into more stable phases. Changes on the thermally and stress induced martensitic transformations were observed after these aging treatments, modifying the thermal and mechanical response of the material. Modifications of the metastable phase transformation diagrams are considered as well as the pseudoelastic fatigue behavior of the alloys. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Structural, microstructural and textural characterizations of oxides were performed and correlated with their redox properties. The results are consistent with the formation of solid solutions with high surface area (SBET∼ 200 m2g-1), constituted by nanoparticles (4-6 nm) with a fluorite type structure but different mesoporosity. Dynamic oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements indicate that the presence of Pd improves the extension of reduction of CZ support, with the higher low-temperature OSC capacity observed for Pd/SC80. Static kinetics measurements, confirm that Pd promotes hydrogen spillover onto CZ favoring both surface and bulk reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) even at 373 K. Pd/SC80 presents considerably higher total OSC (691 versus 400-454 μmol H2g-1) with respect to the other samples. Significant Pd sintering was observed over Pd/ME80 only, with the consequent decrease of redox capability for Pd/ME80 catalyst. On the contrary, Pd/CP80 and Pd/SC80 samples presented highly dispersed Pd and good stability after redox cycling. These findings indicate that CP followed by thermal treatment under supercritical conditions is a promising method to synthesize materials with high low temperature OSC and promissory redox properties due to improved Pd/CZ interaction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

No marked changes on the nanostructure were detected during milling regardless either the type of mill used or composition selected. Mean grain sizes’ values found were between 10 nm and 26 nm for each stage of milling. Power consumption of the milling process was calculated at laboratory scale to analyze the chances of a potential scaling up of the milling process.

  abstract = {© 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. All rights reserved. Releasing and deployment maneuvers carried out during space satellites launching are usually performed by utilizing pyrotechnics loads. However, it is considered convenient to replace this technique by others not requiring explosives (Non Explosive Actuators-NEA). This is mainly due to the necessity of reducing high-shock and vibrations induced levels, also avoiding the contamination of sensible instruments because of dust and gas release during explosion. In addition, the avoidance of risks associated with storage and manipulation of explosives and the possibility of performing device retesting prior to final mounting are desirable qualities. Among NEA devices, those exploiting the singular mechanical behavior of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) have reached commercial maturity. In this study, the performance of a NEA device that uses the mechanical stress generated upon reverse transformation of a mechanically constrained SMA actuator (constrained recovery effect) to generate the controlled fracture of a notched bolt is analyzed. Firstly, the mechanical components of the system are described, and the main problems associated with its design are introduced. Then, the results of the experimental characterization performed on a NiTi SMA cylindrical tube actuator with 12.7 and 7.8 mm outer and inner diameter respectively, are presented. After an activation stage in which the cylinder is compressed to induce the martensitic phase (or re-orient the existing martensític phase), the temperature is raised while a constant displacement condition is imposed. For temperatures near 120 °C, a loads increment of 35 kN (440 MPa) is obtained. The repetition of this loading-unloading-heating-cooling cycle does not generate any important deterioration in the material response.},

  abstract = {When the full stock of a new product is quickly sold in a few days or weeks, one has the impression that new technologies develop and conquer the market in a very easy way. This may be true for some new technologies, for example the cell phone, but not for others, like the blue-ray. Novelty, usefulness, advertising, price, and fashion are the driving forces behind the adoption of a new product. But, what are the key factors that lead to adopt a new technology? In this paper we propose and investigate a simple model for the adoption of an innovation which depends mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the interaction with other agents. Social interactions are taken into account in two ways: by imitation and by differentiation, i.e., some agents will be inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same, but other will act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate from the "herd". We determine the conditions for a successful implantation of the new technology, by considering the strength of advertising and the effect of social interactions. We find a balance between the advertising and the number of anti-herding agents that may block the adoption of a new product. We also compare the effect of social interactions, when agents take into account the behavior of the whole society or just a part of it. In a nutshell, the present model reproduces qualitatively the available data on adoption of innovation.},

A wide range of chemical compositions (13.7 {$<$} Mn {$<$} 27.5 wt.\% and 0 {$<$} Cr {$<$} 12.4 wt.\%) has been studied. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted in order to confirm that the martensitic transformation takes place between an fcc structure and the hcp martensite. Transition temperatures were measured by means of electrical resistivity and dilatometry. All transition temperatures tend to decrease with the increment in Cr content while the addition of Mn decreases the MTTs and increases TN. These different effects and the stabilization effect of the antiferromagnetic ordering on the fcc austenite result in different MTTs behaviors depending on whether the martensitic transition occurs from a magnetically ordered austenite or not. For these later cases, a phenomenological model of MTTs is presented that could be of use for alloys design.},

This result is different to the one found in Cu-Zn-Al thin films with 18R martensitic structure and similar microstructure, in which the hysteresis presents an increment (≈10 times) compared to bulk samples. This difference can be associated to the intrinsic nature of the 2H transformation which requires more undercooling to produce the nucleation of the martensitic phase.

In this way a controlled amount of Zn is transported from the bulk reference into the film, in such a way that the Ms of the film becomes nearly the same as the bulk reference.

Our results indicate that the superconducting properties such as the upper critical field (μ0Hc2 ≈ 10 T) and the superconducting critical temperature (Tc = 12.5 K) are thickness independent for films thicker than \textasciitilde 36 nm. By measuring the critical current density (Jc) in the vortex-free state, which coincides with the depairing current density (J0), we estimate that films thicker than \textasciitilde 36 nm have a coherence length ξ(0) = 5.8 ± 0.2 nm and penetration depth λ(0) = 420 ± 50 nm. We found that it is possible to enhance the Hc2(0) values to close to 10 T without any appreciable reduction in Tc.},

  abstract = {This work presents the microstructural changes of a carbon steel during tempering at low temperatures (first stage of tempering), and its effects in the second and third stages. These changes are determined by internal friction. Internal friction is measured in a forced vibration mode at 5 Hz, in a temperature range from 300 to 600K. Four internal friction peaks appear: S1 at 350K, P1 at 380K, P2 at 440K, P3 at 480K. S1 only appears in the sample tempered at 380K for 20 hours, and this can be related to the reduction of the martensite tetragonality. The height of P1 is lowest when the intensity of tempering is increased. This height can be related to the quantity of epsilon carbide than precipitate. The heights of P2 and P3 are not changed significantly, but the difference of temperature between both is lowest when the tempering intensity is increased. This suggests than the dissolution of epsilon carbide and formation of cementite takes places in a lowest range of temperature. Keywords:},

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior of quenched and tempered steels is analyzed by mechanical spectroscopy (internal friction), hardness measurements, Charpy impact and tensile mechanical tests. In quenched steels, the high dislocation density leads to a stress relaxation mainly based on the Snoek-Köster relaxation, and inhibits the plastic deformation, leading to a predominantly intergranular mechanism of fracture. During tempering, the martensite decomposition decreases the dislocation density and hardness. This leads to a stress relaxation based on both dislocation-enhanced Snoek and Snoek-Koster relaxations, and promotes the fracture mechanism transition from brittle to ductile. This suggests that the Snoek-Köster and dislocation-enhanced Snoek relaxations are correlated with the intergranular and ductile fracture mechanisms, respectively. Nevertheless, the tempered martensite embrittlement cannot be detected by means of internal friction since the strain rate associated to this technique is more similar to the strain rate observed in tensile mechanical test than that observed in Charpy impact test. On the other hand, the risk of embrittlement is increased when the retained austenite is thermally instable.},

On one hand, the decrease of the amplitude of a local maximum at 380. K is correlated with the reduction of interstitial carbon content in the martensite matrix, which is due to the carbide precipitation during the first stage of tempering. On the other hand, the amplitude change of an internal friction peak that appears at 500. K is correlated to the variation of the dislocation density. Both amplitude variations follow a similar trend during quenching and tempering, indicating a correlation between the interstitial carbon content and dislocation density in martensite. This correlation is in agreement with the results obtained by X-ray diffraction, thermoelectric power, and hardness. Additionally, it is possible to observe the Snoek effect in samples that contain ferrite and martensite with low tetragonality due to intercritical austenization or tempering.},

Damping in civil engineering is needed to minimize earthquake effects on buildings, and also to limit the damage produced by wind or traffic induced oscillations in stayed cables in bridges. In this work, we explore the consequences of strain aging the material at moderate temperatures (100. °C). A quasi-static stress and temperature aging of NiTi SMA wires of 2.46. mm diameter was done at 373. K. The experimental measurements establish a monotonic effect related to the introduced strain. Aging under larger strains modifies the hysteretic shape and induces an increase in the maximal stress on the transformation from 600. MPa to 800-1000. MPa. Aging at 373. K under 7-8\% strain, the effect was up to 200. MPa in three months and near 400. MPa in eight months. The modified stress-strain curves suggest potential application as dampers under larger summer-winter temperature changes, i.e., from 233 to 323. K.},

Functional fatigue affecting superelastic behaviour of NiTi wires includes an accumulation of residual strain and an uneven decrement of transformation stress on cycling. Although this evolution is observed to diminish asymptotically, it represents an important loss in the maximum recoverable strain level and in the hysteretic dissipative capacity of the material. In this work, the effect of moderate temperature aging treatment on the functionally degraded material properties was studied with two experimental setups. NiTi pseudoelastic wire samples of 0.5 and 2.46 mm diameter were subjected to different cycling programs intercalated by aging treatments of different durations up to 48 h at 100°C. Results show that important levels of recovery on the residual strains and the transformation stresses were attained after the aging treatments. The analysis indicates that the characteristics of the recovered cycles are rather independent from the treatment duration and from the reached condition before each treatment.},

It consists in the generation of a virtual dog-boned shaped specimen combined with the use of snubbing type of gripping action in order to completely eliminate earlier failures induced by grip-sample interactions. The generation of a virtual dog-boned specimen is based on the localized character of the stress induced martensitic transformation and the evolution of the transformation stresses with further cycling. Reduced pseudoelastic cycles are performed to evaluate functional and structural fatigue with this method. Consistent longer fatigue lives have been obtained compared to traditional gripping methods with fractures occurring inside the region of interest. The present study clearly points to the role of the stress induced transformation in determining the fatigue life. This treatment of the structural fatigue considerable departs from classical approaches but takes into account essential facts like the localized character of the stress induced transformation, the heat effects associated with the first order solid to solid martensitic transformation and its impact on the critical transformation stresses.},

Two types of experiments have been considered to elucidate the question. In the first class, the stress range was kept in between the forward and reverse plateaus levels, thus avoiding evident martensitic stress induced transformation. Strain controlled experiments were performed in wires in fully austenite, fully stress induced martensite and austenite–martensite coexistence zone with nearly half of the wire length transformed to martensite. In the second type of experiments, pseudoelastic cycling was performed. In this case the stress induced austenite to martensite transformation is involved. The obtained results indicate a definite deleterious effect of the stress induced transformation on the fatigue life. Additional important aspects related with fatigue life of NiTi wires like fretting fatigue effects in the grip–specimen contact region and the relative importance of the crack initiation and crack propagation stages on the total fatigue life are also presented.},

It consists in, firstly, performing low speed nearly isothermal pseudoelastic cycles in a limited region of the wire specimen. This results in the stabilization of the pseudooelastic behavior accompanied by a decrease in the stresses for forward and reverse transformations which allows obtaining an equivalent to a geometric dog-bone shaped specimen due to the reduced transformation stresses in the pre-cycled region. In a second stage, by limiting the transformation active zone to the pre-cycled region, the deformation speed can be increased to practical values avoiding any transformation activity outside that region. In that way, grip induced failures resulting in artificially shorter fatigue lives might be completely avoided thus allowing an accurate characterization of the true structural fatigue. Additionally, strain controlled experiments on wires in fully austenite and fully martensite states have been performed. Resulting fatigue lives in these cases were at least two orders of magnitude higher compared with the pseudoelastic fatigue indicating the decisive role played by the stress induced transformation in determining fatigue life. The influence of testing temperature and deformation rate on fatigue life has also been evaluated},

  abstract = {Since reactor pressure vessel steels are ferromagnetic, provide a convenient means to monitor changes in the mechanical properties of the material upon irradiation with high energy particles, by measuring their magnetic properties. Here, we discuss the correlation between mechanical and magnetic properties and microstructure, by studying the flux effect on the nuclear pressure vessel steel used in reactors currently under construction in Argentina. Charpy-V notched specimens of this steel were irradiated in the RA1 experimental reactor at 275°C with two lead factors (LFs), 93 and 183. The magnetic properties were studied by means of DC magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance. The results show that the coercive field and magnetic anisotropy spatial distribution are sensitive to the LF and can be explained by taking into account the evolution of the microstructure with this parameter. The saturation magnetization shows a dominant dependence on the accumulated damage. Consequently, the mentioned techniques are suitable to estimate the degradation of the reactor vessel steel. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Ultrafine-grained (UFG) Al matrix composites reinforced with 15 and 30vol\% in-situ Al3Ti filaments were fabricated by extrusion of Al-Ti powder mixtures followed by solid-state reactive diffusion. Fine Al powder particles (1.3μm) heavily deformed the coarser Ti particles (24.5μm) into filaments during extrusion. Upon a subsequent operation of hot isostatic pressing (HIP), the micrometric Al3Ti filaments elongated along the extrusion direction and formed in situ in the UFG Al matrix. Fabricated composites are free of pores and voids with perfect bonding created at the Al-Al3Ti interfaces. In parallel, a small portion (2.4vol\%) of nanoscale γ-Al2O3 particles, which originate from native amorphous films on fine Al powders, formed in situ and were homogenously dispersed in the Al matrix. The microstructures of as-extruded and after HIP composites were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). Owing to the presence of nanometric γ-Al2O3 particles with Al high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), the UFG Al matrix remained stable even after HIP at 600°C for 9h. The mechanical properties and creep performance of composites at testing temperatures of up to 600°C were systematically studied. The Al-Al3Ti composites exhibited a combination of increased strength and Young's modulus in addition to excellent creep performance and structural stability, which indicates that the studied composites are potential structural materials capable of service at elevated temperatures.},

Both, experimental and numerical results show that at low velocities there is no dependence of the transition temperatures, whereas at higher speeds they gradually increase.

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In order to treat this phenomenon in thermodynamic terms it is necessary to account for the composition dependence of the Néel temperature (TN) of the alloy and the entropy change (ΔSmg) associated to the loss of the antiferromagnetic ordering. In the present work the composition dependence of these properties in Fe-Mn and Fe-Mn-Co alloys have been established by performing systematic measurements of the heat capacity.

  abstract = {© 2016 American Physical Society.Bimagnetic nanoparticles have been proposed for the design of new materials with controlled properties, which requires a comprehensive investigation of their magnetic behavior due to multiple effects arising from their complex structure. In this work we fabricated bimagnetic core/shell nanoparticles formed by an ∼3-nm antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO core encapsulated within an ∼1.5-nm ferrimagnetic (FiM) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 shell, aiming at studying the enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy and the surface effects of a ferrimagnetic oxide shell. The magnetic properties of as-synthesized and annealed samples were analyzed by ac and dc magnetization measurements. The results indicate that the magnetic response of the as-synthesized particles is governed by the superparamagnetic behavior of the interacting nanoaggregates of spins that constitute the disordered ferrimagnetic shell, whose total moments block at (TB)=49 K and collectively freeze in a superspin-glass-type state at (Tg)=3 K. On the other hand, annealed nanoparticles are superparamagnetic at room temperature and behave as an exchange-coupled system below the blocking temperature (TB)=70 K, with enhanced coercivity HC(10K)∼14.6 kOe and exchange bias field HEB(10K)∼2.3 kOe, compared with the as-synthesized system where HC(10K)∼5.5 kOe and HEB(10K)∼0.8 kOe.

  abstract = {The Nd60Fe30Al10alloy exhibits a large glass forming ability which allows to obtain relatively thick cast rods containing large volume fractions of amorphous phases. In this work the microstructure and the hard magnetic properties of as-cast rods are characterized. The alloy is processed by suction casting into a chilled copper mould to obtain cylinders 5 mm diameter and 50 mm length. This diameter is selected because it is an upper limit for this processing route, beyond which the hard properties largely deteriorate. A room temperature coercivity of 0.34 T is obtained. The sample microstructure is heterogeneous, with very different size scales near the surface and along the central zone. However, in both regions a large fraction of an amorphous ferromagnetic phase is observed; it is found that paramagnetic nanocrystalline phases - mainly Nd or Nd-rich particles, embedded in the amorphous matrix - are somewhat coarser in the central zone. These larger nanocrystals, less efficient to pin domain walls, are proposed to be responsible for the lower coercive fields observed, as compared with those found in cylinders 1-3 mm diameter where no inhomogeneities are found.

In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening of the positron-electron annihilation radiation was used to provide information about the chemical environment surrounding vacancy-like defects. The results obtained for the silver-free alloy indicate that, immediately after quenching from the solution treatment temperature, vacancy v-Cu-Mg clusters are formed in the supersaturated solid solution. During the early stages of ageing these clusters become richer in Cu and Mg and laths of the S phase (Al{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$}CuMg) nucleate preferentially on dislocation lines. Continued ageing led to gradual precipitation of an equi-axed phase in the matrix between the S phase laths which is believed to be the cubic Z phase thought previously to form only if silver is present. For the silver-containing Al-Cu-Mg alloy, v-Cu-Mg-Ag aggregates also form immediately after quenching and the solute transport mechanisms are the same. However, precipitation of the S phase is suppressed during ageing and the silver addition promotes accelerated formation of a finer dispersion of smaller equi-axed Z phase precipitates. For both alloys, no evidence was found that the Z phase is preceded by any pre-precipitate or GP zones. Combination of coincidence Doppler broadening and microanalysis results revealed the Z phase to have a Mg:Cu ratio of 2 which indicates that it differs from the well known T phase (Al{$<$}inf{$>$}6{$<$}/inf{$>$}CuMg{$<$}inf{$>$}4{$<$}/inf{$>$}) which the equilibrium phase diagram indicates should form in Al-Cu-Mg alloys with high Mg:Cu ratios. Additional ageing experiments at 240 °C showed that neither the Z phase or T phase are formed in the ternary alloy, but only precipitates of the S phase, while in the quaternary alloy the S phase is strongly suppressed and mainly Z phase precipitates are formed.},

  abstract = {Neutron absorbers are elements with a high neutron capture cross section that are employed at nuclear reactors to control excess fuel reactivity. If these absorbers are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section as the result of neutron absorption, they consume during the reactor core life and so are called burnable. These elements can be distributed inside an oxide ceramic that is stable under irradiation and thus called inert. Cubic zirconium oxide is one of the preferred materials to be used as inert matrix. It is stable under irradiation, experiments very low swelling, and is isomorphic to uranium oxide. The cubic phase is stabilized by adding small amounts of dopants like Dy 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 . As both dysprosium and gadolinium have a high neutron cross section, they are good candidates to prepare burnable neutron absorbers. Pyrochlores, like Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 , allow the solid solution of a large quantity of elements besides being stable under irradiation. These characteristics make them also useful for safe storage of nuclear wastes. We present a preliminary study of the thermal analysis of different compositions in the systems Gd 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 and Dy 2 O 3 -TiO 2 , investigating the feasibility to obtain oxide ceramics useful for the nuclear industry.},

El empleo de metales en polvo lleva a tener una porosidad asociada a las paredes de las mismas que afecta a las propiedades mecánicas, provocando la falla a tensiones menores de lo esperable. Se optimizó el método de fabricación seleccionando los parámetros de sinterizado (presión de compactado, temperatura y atmósfera). Para caracterizar la meso y microestructura de las muestras se emplearon técnicas de microscopía tradicionales (microscopio electrónico de barrido SEM) y tomografía de rayos x. Esta última técnica permite visualizar en 3D la distribución de las celdas, realizar una caracterización completa de la mesoestructura, evaluar la porosidad de las muestras y seguir la evolución de la deformación de las celdas en ensayos de compresión.},

  abstract = {Fe-Mn-based alloys show the shape memory effect which is mainly related to the FCC-HCP martensitic transformation. Cr is one of the additional elements which improve the properties of these alloys. In the present work structural data are obtained for the FCC austenite, and both martensitic structures, HCP and BCC, for an extended composition range where the FCC-HCP transition takes place. Lattice parameters are determined by X-Ray diffraction measurements performed at room temperature. The volume change between the austenite and each martensitic structure plays a significant role on relevant properties for martensitic transformations, like the strain energy associated to the transition. The effect of Mn and Cr on lattice parameters and volume change between FCC and HCP is determined and modeling of the data is presented. This result allows estimating the strain energy associated to the phase change. By using this information, the strain energy contribution to the balance of energy for the HCP nucleation is discussed. The addition of Cr decreases the volume change between FCC and HCP for contents larger than 12 wt\% Cr which leads to a decrease of the strain energy. Both effects favor an increased shape memory effect associated to the FCC-HCP martensitic transition.},

Microstructure was determined using X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Results were compared to thermodynamic models. In the ternary alloys under study, the lattice parameter of the Cu-Ni solid solution was generally correlated to the amounts of nickel incorporated into the Cu lattice. However, longer milling times reduced that lattice parameter and facilitated Zr insertion into the solid solution. For example, after 5 h of milling time, microstructural analysis showed the formation of a solid solution with cubic structure in Cu-43Ni-7Zr. This pattern is consistent with the presence of a lattice parameter between that of Cu and Ni (α−phase); in contrast, the Cu-33Ni-7Zr alloy showed an α-phase and another similar to Zr. Results suggest that, as the amount of nickel increases, the ability to form an amorphous phase decreases. Additionally, experimental and thermodynamic data showed a solid-solution formation stage, followed by an amorphous phase formation stage that occurred as milling time and Zr content increased.},

EG-PVP produces nanoparticles (NPs) with a narrow size distribution, but some of them remain covered by impurities after the synthesis. After successive voltammetric cycles, NPs become cleaner, but some agglomeration and structural modification occur; these effects affect the electrochemical behavior of Pd/C in different ways, so we used CO as a probe to better understand the processes taking place. CO stripping shows that the general features of the multiple oxidation peaks change with the number of cycles. Possibly, CO and OH from different NPs react when the particles agglomerate, contributing to CO stripping changes. Finally, different active areas are found when the charges involved in CO oxidation and PdO reduction are compared. Such differences are rationalized in terms of a balance between the increase of sites which promote the oxidation of CO and the loss of area provoked by the growing of the particles.},

  abstract = {In the last decades ethanol and glycerol arose as potential fuels for fuel cells. Based on their importance to the field and molecular similarity, here we compare the electrooxidation of ethanol and glycerol on platinum nanoparticles as an attempt to learn about their differences and similarities in terms of oxidation pathways. By using in situ FTIR we interpret the electrochemical behavior in terms of different pathways involving the production of carboxylic acids for both alcohols. For ethanol, CO2is produced from CO in a direct pathway involving several electrons, while acetic acid is produced through a parallel pathway. Conversely, for glycerol CO2seems to be mainly produced through a sequential pathway involving carboxylic acids, each one involving few electrons. The results suggest that glycerol demands surfaces that speed up the oxidation of partially oxidized species formed at intermediate potentials. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Anodes and cathodes of fuel cells are usually composed of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on carbon, in order to increase their active area. Since the degradation of the catalyst affects the performance of the fuel cells, understanding the stability of its components is pivotal to make these systems more reliable. As such, graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes have been employed as alternative supports to improve the stability of anodes in fuel cells. In this context, we have used polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) combined with a one-step chemical reduction induced by ethylene glycol to synthesize Pd NPs dispersed on chemically converted graphene (CCG). We compared the electrochemical stability of Pd NPs supported on carbon black (C), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and CCG. MWCNTs and CCG make Pd NPs electrochemically more stable than carbon black. Pd/CCG catalysts are more stable than Pd/MWCNTs during the first potential cycles, while Pd/MWCNTs showed a higher long-term stability. These results allow us to consider a competition between agglomeration of NPs and degradation of the support, where the agglomeration seems to be limited by the available surface area of the support.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) on Ag(111) and Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical techniques, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results show that MBA molecules adsorb intact on the Ag (111) surface via a thiolate bond, arranged in a (√3 × 4) lattice with coverage θ = 0.25. The phase diagram built using DFT data shows that this lattice is more stable than the dense (√7 × √7)R19.1° MBA lattices on reconstructed Ag(111) surfaces. No significant amounts of sulfide were found neither on the Ag(111) surfaces nor on MBA-protected AgNPs, suggesting that the Ag core@Ag-sulfide shell structure where thiolates could be grafted cannot be applied to the MBA-protected AgNPs. Slow degradation of the MBA protective layer in ambient conditions on the AgNPs results in disulfide formation and AgNP sintering. ■ INTRODUCTION Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols on Au and Ag have attracted considerable attention in the past 25 years due to their multiple applications in nanoscience and nanotechnol-ogy. 1−5 Previous works have shown that thiols adsorb on Ag(111) as thiolates forming at saturation coverage a distorted (√7 × √7)R19.1° lattice with θ ≈ 0.44. The molecules adopt a standing-up configuration with a tilt angle between α ≈ 0− 19°. 6,7 On the other hand, experimental data from different techniques indicate that the strong thiol adsorption induces a reconstruction of the Ag(111) surface. 8 The first model, proposed for methanethiol (MT) on the reconstructed Ag(111) surface (R), involves a near-hexagonal surface layer with a Ag density that is only 3/7 of the underlying substrate layers and with the organic molecules adsorbed into 3-fold coordinated hollow sites. 9 This arrangement is also consistent with the observed (√7 × √7)R19.1° lattice (nearest-neighbor distance d = 0.44 nm) although the substrate has been strongly reconstructed by vacancies formation. Later, it was shown that this model does not imply a better thermodynamic stability since it has a similar surface free energy value (γ) to that estimated for the (√7 × √7)R19.1° MT lattice on the unreconstructed (U) surface. It is not surprising because the formation of 4/7 Ag vacancies implies a large energy cost.},

Mössbauer spectrum at 4 K shows typical hyperfine parameters of maghemite and Transmission Electron Microscopy images reveal that the nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 3.9 nm and a narrow size distribution. AC magnetic susceptibility in zero field presents an Arrhenius behavior with unreasonable relaxation parameters due to the strong influence of dipolar interaction. In contrast when the measurements are performed in a 1 kOe field, the effect of dipolar interactions becomes negligible and the obtained parameters are in good agreement with the static magnetic properties. The dynamic energy barrier obtained from the AC susceptibility results is larger than the expected from the average size observed by HRTEM results, evidencing the strong influence of the surface contribution to the anisotropy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The nanoparticles present high saturation magnetization and superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, and the hydrodynamic diameters of DEXTRAN- and PEG-coated SPIONs were measured as 170 and 120 nm, respectively. PEG- and DEXTRAN-coated SPIONs have a Specific Power Absorption SPA of 320 and 400 W/g, respectively, in an ac magnetic field with amplitude of 13 kA/m and frequency of 256 kHz. In vitro studies using VERO and MDCK cell lineages were performed to study the cytotoxicity and cell uptake of the SPIONs. For both cell lineages, PEG- and DEXTRAN-coated nanoparticles presented high cell viability for concentrations as high as 200 μg/mL. In vivo studies were conducted using BALB/c mice inoculating the SPIONs intravenously and exposing them to the presence of an external magnet located over the tumour. It was observed that the amount of PEG-coated SPIONs in the tumor increased by up to 160\% when using the external permanent magnetic as opposed to those animals that were not exposed to the external magnetic field.},

Ln2NiO4+δelectrodes were deposited onto CGO and YSZ electrolytes by aerography and treated at 900 °C during 1 h in order to promote electrode adhesion. EIS spectra were collected between 500 and 800 °C in dry air. The Polarization Resistances (PR) values for La2NiO4/CGO/La2NiO4cell are higher than those of La2NiO4/YSZ/La2NiO4. The PR for both cells and its evolution in time suggest that chemical reactivity is developed at 900 °C during the adhesion treatment and at T higher than 650 °C during the EIS measurements.

Annealing temperatures (533 K–623 K) at short times (0–30 min) produce systematic increment of the fraction of γ2-phase. Films with phase coexistence of hexagonal, γ2 and L21 structure display temperature driven martensitic transformation. This transformation is observed for samples with austenite grain size of around 30 nm. In all cases, the martensitic transformation temperature (MS) notoriously decreases (compared to bulk) and systematically increases with the annealing temperatures and annealing time. In addition, the films display extended transformation and retransformation ranges along with asymmetric hysteresis, which may be associated to restitutive forces due to elastic deformations at martensite – martensite and martensite – austenite interfaces. Annealing temperatures above 623 K produce fast precipitation to equilibrium α- and γ2-phases. The austenitic phase can be recovered after annealing over 1000 K and fast quenching in ice-water.},

The effects of the machine and load train compliances on the respective displacements values were carefully evaluated. The significance of the different displacements definitions was demonstrated by proposing two alternative procedures for assessing the specimen thickness evolution and by revising the definition of the load associated with the determination of the material yield stress from SPT. To facilitate the systematic study of the influence of the different parameters that might be affecting the test, a finite element (FEM) analysis tool was developed. The results obtained from FEM simulations show that even using a constitutive model that does not include damage initiation it is possible to adequately reproduce the SPT load vs. displacement response curve to near maximum load and also the diametral profiles of the deformed specimens. The FEM analysis indicate the arbitrary character of the different proposals for determination of the load for yield stress estimation with them corresponding to different degrees of plastic deformation of the specimen.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the effect of pre-ageing between 293 K and 373 K in a 6082 Aluminum alloy using mainly differential scanning calorimetry in combination with Vickers hardness and transmission electron microscopy. The pre-ageing effects are characterized through the modifications of the β″ precipitation DSC signal. Pre-ageing at 293 K leads to a progressive increase of the peak temperature, until it reaches a plateau at long aging times (≥250min), while pre-ageing at 373 K leads to a continuous decrease of the peak temperature. The results indicate the formation of two different types of clusters, named 1 and 2, below and above a pre-ageing transition temperature, determined to be around 343 K. After pre-ageing below 343 K, the dissolution of clusters 1 superimposed with the β″ precipitation occurs, and the enthalpy change remains almost independent of pre-ageing time. Instead, pre-ageing above 343 K leads to the formation of type 2 clusters that transform on heating into β″ phase precipitates, with a decreasing enthalpy change as pre-ageing time increases. This result indicates that clusters 2 evolve during pre-ageing, reaching a structure/composition with formation enthalpy similar to that of β″ phase. Vickers hardness reveals the different evolution of both types of clusters with aging time. Transmission electron microscopy observations on samples subsequently aged at 453 K, show that type 2 clusters favour the nucleation of β″ precipitates, while type 1 clusters hamper such nucleation process.},

  abstract = {As cast Cu90Co10 ribbons rapidly solidified by twin-roller melt spinning, exhibit special microstructure features. This processing method provides scenarios where a different phase selection takes place; coherent Co precipitates form directly from solidification, with neither a spinodal-like composition oscillation nor a discontinuously precipitated laminar phase. Samples are processed at tangential wheel speeds of 10 m/s (V10), 15 m/s (V15), 20 m/s (V20) and 30 m/s (V30). Microstructures resulting from this single step process are characterized and the hysteresis properties and the magnetoresistance effects evaluated. Samples V30 have a quite uniform density of coherent precipitates, with a narrow size distribution around 4 nm. On contrary, non-uniform precipitate distributions are found in samples cooled at lower rates; zones with a high density of coherent Co-rich precipitates are found forming colonies. These colonies are consistent with the extended compositional fluctuations occurring during very early stages in the cooling process. Samples may exhibit wide (V10) and even bimodal (V15) size distributions. Only samples V30 behave close to the ideal superparamagnetism. Samples V20 present relatively large coercivity and relative remanence and behave as an interacting superparamagnet, while the hysteresis loops of ribbons cooled at lower rates exhibit a ferromagnetic contribution in addition to the superparamagnetic-like one. This ferromagnetic component arises from blocked precipitates, larger than the upper bound size for superparamagnetic behavior at 300 K (12 nm). Room temperature magnetoresistance values associated to granular scattering units decrease as the mean precipitate size increases, but they remain below 2\%, which is lower than that measured in samples annealed after rapid solidification, indicating that in this latter case contributions from the spinodally segregated matrix take place in addition to that of Co granules.},

  abstract = {Magnetoresistive Cu Co alloys have been produced by twin roller melt spinning at tangential wheel speeds between 10 m/s and 30 m/s to obtain different solute and Co-rich precipitate distributions. X-ray diffraction indicates that the ribbons are polycrystalline with a Cu(Co) (200) textured matrix; no evidence of a spinodal-like composition modulation could be detected with this technique. Transmission electron microscopy observations performed in samples quenched at 10 m/s indicate the existence of small, coherent, Co-rich precipitates ofmean size of about 11 nm and bigger ( nm) Co-oxide particles. The small coherent precipitates formcolonies inside the grains, mediated by precipitate free zones. Samples quenched at 30 m/s are single magnetic phase (superparamagnetic), but the hysteresis loops of the other as cast ribbons are well fitted by a superparamagnetic contribution and a ferromagnetic one, the latter arising from the Co-rich precipitates. Room temperature coercivities, of about 30–50 mT, are lower than those predicted for a mecha- nism of coherent rotation in the ensemble of non-interacting, Co-rich precipitates.},

The formation of R-phase can be detected in the mechanical experiments. It is shown that the stress-strain response of the R-phase can be isolated from the overall stress-strain data. The R-phase always forms prior to B19¢ when good pseudoelastic properties are observed. The stress-induced B2 to R-phase transition occurs in a homogeneous manner, contrary to the localized character of the B2/R to B19¢ transformations. The temperature dependence of the critical stress values for the formation of the martensitic phases shows a Clausius Clapeyron type of behavior with constants close to 6 MPa/K (B19¢) and 18 MPa/K (R-phase).

The general purpose of the present work is to develop a predictive approach to this problem, and assess its accuracy by confronting thermodynamic calculations with experimental observations on Cu-Zn nanoparticles. The bases of the approach are as follows. First, the present Gibbs energy formalism makes use of the “lattice-stability” concept currently applied in so-called CALPHAD (“Calculation of Phase Diagrams”) modeling work. Second, the enthalpy of formation of the alloy phases is treated in the framework of the Miedema model, with special attention to the parameters for the amorphous phase. Third, the surface contribution to Gibbs energy is accounted for. With the current thermodynamic description, the sizes of the crystalline nanoparticles which are stable with respect to the amorphous are determined by calculation. These predictions are confronted with the minimum size of the nanoparticles generated by subjecting γ-Cu-Zn powders to low-energy milling treatments, which is determined by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. On this basis, a discussion is reported of the accuracy of the present approach. In particular, the parameters in the Gibbs energy description which crucially affect the agreement between calculations and experiments are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The theme of the present work is the procedure for evaluating the minimum size for the stability of a crystalline particle with respect to the same group of atoms but in the amorphous state. A key goal of the study is the critical analysis of an extensively quoted paper by F.G. Shi [J. Mater. Res. 9 (1994) 1307–1313], who presented a criterion for evaluating a “crystallinity distance” (h) through its relation with the “critical diameter” (dC) of a particle, i.e., the diameter below which no particles with the crystalline structure are expected to exist at finite temperatures. Key assumptions of Shi's model are a direct proportionality relation between h and dC, and a prescription for estimating h from crystallographic information. In the present work the accuracy of the Shi model is assessed with particular reference to nanoparticles of the elements. To this end, an alternative way to obtain h, that better realizes Shi's idea of this quantity as “the height of a monolayer of atoms on the bulk crystal surface”, is explored. Moreover, a thermodynamic calculation of dC, which involves a description of the bulk- and the surface contributions to the crystalline/amorphous relative phase stability for nanoparticles, is performed. It is shown that the Shi equation does not account for the key features of the h vs. dC relation established in the current work. Consequently, it is concluded that the parameter h obtained only from information about the structure of the crystalline phase, does not provide an accurate route to estimate the quantity dC. In fact, a key result of the current study is that dC crucially depends on the relation between bulk- and surface contributions to the crystalline/amorphous relative thermodynamic stability.},

Measurements of the electrical resistance as a function of temperature at different constant mechanical loads accompanied by complementary experiments with variable loads at constant temperature were performed. Results show that the transformation mechanisms in UFG microstructures exhibit a higher level of complexity when compared with those characterizing the behavior of other microstructures (e.g., recrystallized or larger grains size). It was found that a threshold stress level below 150 MPa delimits the transition from a homogeneous (low stress) to localized but reversible Lüders type transformation (high stress) when the transformations are induced under constant applied stress and that reorientation processes require stresses of 100 MPa in the present UFG wires. Even though the strain evolutions do not always show two distinct yielding events during cooling or heating, electrical resistance measurements proved that a two-step transformation involving R-phase and B19′ martensite was always present in the extended range of temperatures and stresses investigated here.},

  abstract = {Martensitic phase transformations were studied in ultrafine grained Ni-rich pseudoelastic NiTi wires during cyclic deformation under small imposed strain amplitudes. Small strain variation tests were complemented by a thermographic analysis of the emerging temperature distributions in the specimens. The characteristics of the observed thermal profiles result from the specific phase transitions which take place at different stress levels. Homogeneous temperature changes, corresponding to a non-localized transformation activity along the specimen length, were observed throughout the whole range of applied stresses, starting from values as low as 100 MPa. This behavior is in line with previous literature reports for the stress-induced transformation from B2 austenite to R-phase as long as the critical stress for B19′ martensite formation is not reached. In the present study, similar type of transformation activity could also be demonstrated at higher strains/stresses, even after the stress induced transformation to B19′ was apparently completed. These findings suggest that transformation activity involving the B2 phase is present throughout the whole pseudoelastic stress-strain cycle; i.e., it is not restricted to the initial loading portion. Finally, non-localized transformation to or from B19′ was identified during small amplitude strain variations in the plateau-like coexistence ranges of the pseudoelastic cycle.},

A close examination into a single triangular-shape nanoplate reveals that the most irregular area of the nanoplate is consistent with the higher Raman enhancement of Rh6G when compared to other areas of the same feature. This work may shed light onto new ways of transferring graphene, fundamental aspects concerning local strains in the heterojunction, and SERS on a single Au nanostructure.}

Experimental results revealed that straightforward transfer of citrate-capped Au nanoparticles from an aqueous environment to a toluenic solution of amphiphilic hyperbranched polymers results in the spontaneous integration of the nanocrystals into the extended hydrophilic domains of self-assembled supramolecular structures. In this way, we were able to self-organize metal-polymer nanoarchitectures in solution displaying interesting thermoactive functions, i.e.: hybrid assemblies exhibiting negative thermal expansion coefficients. We consider that this strategy has potentiality to realize self-organized supramolecular hetero-assemblies as it provides an alternative methodology to spontaneously integrate nanoscale building blocks into preformed supramolecular objects. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Stoichiometric Ni2MnGa alloys are processed by two rapid solidification techniques – single-roller (SR) and twin-roller (TR) melt spinning – and the resulting microstructures and magnetic properties determined. Samples processed at tangential wheel speeds of 10 m/s (V10) and 15 m/s (V15) are studied in the as-cast condition to analyze the influence of the production methods on the microstructure. Important aspects like the resulting phases, their crystallographic texture, magnetic properties, martensitic transformation temperatures and Curie temperatures are compared. In addition, the magnetization mechanism involving twin boundary motion is explored. Our results indicate that the TR method provides lower cooling rates, thicker samples, higher internal stresses and larger MnS precipitates. However, the quenching rate is mainly determined by the tangential wheel velocity. TR samples also exhibit [100] texture normal to the ribbon plane but in a lesser extent than SR ribbons. Martensitic transformation temperatures are higher in samples V15 (\textasciitilde{} 150 K) than in V10 (\textasciitilde{} 100 K), with no clear difference between the SR and TR modes. This behavior is explained by considering distinct degrees of disorder in the L21 austenite phase resulting from quenching. The hysteresis of the transformation, defined as the difference Af − MS, takes similar values in the four samples analyzed. Pre-martensitic transformation temperatures are also slightly higher in samples V15, (230 ± 3) K, than in samples V10, (222 ± 3) K, as the magnitude of the Hopkinson effect, in good agreement with a higher residual stress level in TR ribbons. In the martensitic state, all ribbons exhibit hysteresis loops characteristic of a magnetization mechanism involving twin boundary motion. The switching magnetic fields for the onset of Type I twin boundary motion result between 220 mT and 365 mT, values equivalent to twinning stresses of about 1 MPa. It is concluded that both procedures, SR and TR melt spinning, provide microstructures favoring magnetic field induced twin variant reorientation.},

The resulting microstructures were previously characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and by transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM). EDS results indicated that all the alloys have the composition Ni2MnGa; at room temperature and above this temperature, a cubic L2(1) ferromagnetic ordered austenitic phase is observed. The Curie temperatures and the magnitude of the Hopkinson effect are estimated from the magnetic polarization versus temperature curves measured in a Faraday balance, in the range 300 K-400 K. As expected for samples with identical composition, the Curie temperatures remain insensitive to the processing route.

At room temperature, the major phase in the as-cast alloys is the cubic L21Ni2MnGa ordered austenitic phase, with a lattice parameter only ∼0.1\% larger than the tabulated value. The order domain size in the austenitic phase decreases from (40±1) nm in samples V10 to (19±1) nm in V20. Mn(S,Se) small precipitates are also found uniformly embedded in the ribbons with mean size of (26±2) nm (V10) and (7±2) nm (V20), exhibiting a definite orientation relation with the austenitic matrix, {$<$}1 0 0{$>$}P// {$<$}1 0 0{$>$}a. The as-cast alloys transform to an intermediate cubic phase I at about 220-230 K depending on the quenching rate and to a martensitic phase at about 130 K. The high temperature austenitic phase and the low temperature martensitic phase are ferromagnetic; in both cases the saturation polarization is lower in samples quenched at higher rates. The demagnetization curves measured from saturation in the martensitic state show two marked steps: a first one for positive fields in V15 and V10 (∼46 mT) and a larger second one for relatively large inverse fields (∼130-250 mT) in all the samples. These steps are likely to arise from a demagnetization mechanism involving a field induced twin boundary motion in the few martensite variants selected by the crystallographic texture and the quenched stresses in the ribbons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), room temperature vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and SQUID measurements are employed for structural, morphological and magnetic sample characterization. For all the concentrations analyzed, the powder nanocomposites actually consist of spinel NiZn ferrite nanoparticles, dispersed in an amorphous silica matrix. TEM studies reveal different particle size distributions and particle morphologies for the three ferrite contents. The 20 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples consist of nearly spherical nanoparticles, of about 8 nm, mainly superparamagnetic, well-dispersed in the amorphous silica matrix, while the 5 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples exhibit a bimodal particle size distribution (5 and 30 nm) of single-domain nanoparticles embedded in the silica. In the 50 wt.\%-NiZn ferrite samples, two particle families are observed: small round superparamagnetic nanoparticles of about 8 nm embedded in the amorphous silica matrix and large, non-spherical, ferrimagnetic ones, forming agglomerates outside the matrix. In all the synthesized samples, thickness fringes are observed inside some of the ferrite nanoparticles in dark field images. This contrast is explained using the theory of electron diffraction in a weak beam dark field (WBDF) condition and considering spherical ferrite nanoparticles. A large range of tailored magnetic properties varying the fraction, dispersion and mean size of the ferrimagnetic NiZn ferrite particles is obtained. Room temperature saturation magnetization values are found in the range 3.0-30.4 Am2/kg for the different concentration samples. Coercivity values, between 1.9 and 7.6 mT, are more than 50\% higher than those measured in powders of pure stoichiometric NiZn ferrite nanoparticles and somewhat higher than those reported for similar NiZn ferrite/SiO2nanocomposites also synthesized by sol-gel processes.

The presence of LiBH4during the milling process noticeably modifies the size and morphology of the Mg agglomerates, leading to faster hydrogenation and reaching almost the theoretical hydrogen capacity owing to enhanced hydrogen diffusion mechanism. However, the dehydrogenation of the system at low temperatures (≤300°C) is still slow. Thus, FeF;bsubesub \& addition is proposed to improve the dehydrogenation kinetic behavior. From experimental results, it is found that the presence of FeF;bsubesub \& results in an additional size reduction of the Mg agglomerates between ∼10 and ∼100 μm and the formation of stable phases such as MgF;bsubesub\&, LiF and FeB. The FeB species might have a catalytic effect upon the MgH;bsubesub\& decomposition. As a further result of the FeF;bsubesub\& addition, the Mg-10 mol\%LiBH;bsubesub\&-5 mol\% FeF;bsubesub\& material shows improved dehydrogenation properties: reduced dehydrogenation activation energy, faster hydrogen desorption rate and reversible hydrogen capacities of about 5 wt\% at 275°C. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, particle size distributions formed by solid-state precipitation are generally not well controlled. Here we demonstrate, through the example of core-shell precipitates in Al-Sc-Li alloys, an approach to forming highly monodisperse particle size distributions by simple solid-state reactions. The approach involves the use of a two-step heat treatment, whereby the core formed at high temperature provides a template for growth of the shell at lower temperature. If the core is allowed to grow to a sufficient size, the shell develops in a 'size focusing' regime, where smaller particles grow faster than larger ones. These results suggest strategies for manipulating precipitate size distributions in similar systems through simple variations in thermal treatments.},

Motivated by the high solubility of In in (mC44) η′-Cu6Sn5compound as well as the occurrence of an In-doped η′-intermetallic in the microstructure of Cu/In-Sn/Cu solder joints, a theoretical study has been carried out to investigate the various physical effects of incorporating In at Sn Wyckoff sites of the binary η′-phase. Systematic ab~initio calculations using the projected augmented wave method and Vienna Ab~initio Simulation Package were used to determine the composition dependence of the structural and cohesive properties of η′-Cu6(Sn,In)5compounds, compared with those expected from the binary end-member compounds Cu6Sn5and Cu6In5. The molar volume shows significant deviations from Vegard’s law. The predicted composition dependence of the cohesive properties is discussed using two complementary approaches, viz. a valence-electron density approach as well as a bond-number approach, both accounting for the roughly linear dependence of the cohesive energy on the In content. A microscopic interpretation for this general trend is given in terms of the key contributions to chemical bonding in this class of compounds, namely Cu d-electron overlap and hybridization of Cu d-states with In and Sn p-electron states. Moreover, a crystallographic site approach is developed to accurately establish the phase-stabilizing effect of incorporating In at specific Wyckoff positions of the (mC44) η′-Cu6Sn5structure.},

The work relies upon a database with total-energy versus volume information developed by using projected augmented waves (PAW) calculations. In previous papers by the current authors it was shown that these results account satisfactorily for the direct and indirect experimental data available. In the present work, the database is further expanded to investigate the composition dependence of the volume (V0), and the composition and volume dependence of the bulk modulus (B0) and cohesive energy (Ecoh). On these bases, an analysis is performed of the systematic effects of replacing Cu by Ni in several Me-X phases (Me=Cu,Ni and X=In,Sn) reported as stable and metastable, as well as various hypothetical compounds involved in the thermodynamic modeling of IPs using the Compound-Energy Formalism. Moreover, it is shown that the cohesion-related quantities (B0/V0)-and (Ecoh-/V0) can be correlated with a parameter expressing the number of valence electrons per unit volume. These findings are compared in detail with related relations involving the Miedema empirical electron density at the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz cell. In view of the co-variation of the cohesive properties, Ecohis selected as a key property and its composition and structure dependence is examined in terms of a theoretical view of the bonding which involves the hybridization of the d-states of Cu or Ni with the s and p-states of In or Sn, for this class of compounds. In particular, a comparative analysis is performed of the DOS of various representative, iso-structural Me-X compounds. Various effects of relevance to understand the consequences of replacing Cu by Ni in LFS alloys are highlighted and explained microscopically for the first time.},

  abstract = {The physico-chemical properties of the intermetallic phases in the Cu-In system have been a matter of considerable theoretical and experimental interest in connection with, i.a., the application of In-Sn alloys as lead-free micro-soldering alloys. Recently, a new binary compound with the chemical formula Cu10In7has been detected in a study of the η-phase field. The structure of the Cu10In7phase has been determined as closely related to that of the Cu11In9compound occurring in the phase diagram, but no experimental or theoretical information on its electronic structure, thermodynamic and equation-of-state properties has yet been reported. In the present work we report the lattice parameters, bulk modulus, energy of formation from the constituent elements and the electronic structure of the new phase, calculated by applying an ab initio density-functional-theory method. Our calculation technique uses the projector augmented wave potentials and the exchange-correlation functions of Perdew and Wang in the generalized gradient approximation. The present results for the Cu10In7phase are compared with the experimental data available, and with the trends in structural and thermodynamic properties emerging from ab initio calculations also performed in the present study for various structurally related and neighboring compounds in the Cu-In phase diagram, viz., the ideal B82-Cu2In, B81-CuIn, B82-CuIn2phases and the Cu11In9compound. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The present paper reports a comparative account of the structural, cohesive and thermodynamic stability properties of the binary intermetallic phases (IPs) occurring in the Cu-In and the Cu-Sn phase diagrams, both at low and at high temperatures, based upon systematic density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Using the projector augmented wave method and the exchange and correlation functions of Perdew and Wang in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as well as the local-density-approximation (LDA) with the Ceperley and Alder exchange and correlation potentials, we determine the lattice-parameters, molar volume, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative, the electronic density of states (DOS) and the energy of formation (EOF) from the elements of the δ-Cu7In3(aP40), γ-Cu9In4(cP52) and CuIn2(tI12) compounds of the Cu-In system. Moreover, DFT-GGA calculations were performed for the compounds: γ-Cu4Sn (cF16), ξ-Cu10Sn3(hP26), -Cu3Sn both in the (oP8) structure and the (oP80) superstructure, η′-Cu6Sn5(mC44) and η-Cu5Sn4both in the η1(mP36) and η2(mC54) structural forms. In addition, the hypothetical structures obtained by replacing In (or Sn) by Sn (or In) are studied, because of their relevance in the CALPHAD modeling of the Cu-In-Sn phase diagram. The work includes a discussion of the composition dependence of the structural and equation-of-state parameters, the electronic DOS, the EOF of the compounds and the differences between the results of the GGA or LDA calculations and the measured values. Besides, various quantities expressing the relative stability of the IPs are introduced and compared with experimental data and with indirect information obtained in a CALPHAD-type two-sublattice modeling of the Cu-In-Sn phase diagram. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The thermodynamic modeling of non-stoichiometric, multisublattice intermetallic phases using the Compound-Energy Formalism (CEF) involves the determination of parameters representing the Gibbs energy (Gm) of binary compounds, the so-called "end-member compounds" (EMCs), which are often metastable or hypothetical. In current CALPHAD (i.e., "Calculation of Phase Diagrams") work, these quantities are treated as free parameters to be determined by searching for the best fit to the available information in the optimization procedure. The general purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical approach to the study of the EMCs which makes use of density-functional-theory (DFT) ab initio calculations. The present method is applied to the EMCs involved in the CEF modeling of the non-stoichiometric (hP6) Ni2In-structure type phase of the Ni-In and Ni-In-Sn systems using the three-sublattice models (Ni)1(Ni,Va)1(In,Ni)1and (Ni,Va)1(Ni,Va)1(In,Ni,Sn)1, respectively. By means of systematic ab initio projected augmented waves (PAW) calculations using the VASP code we study the EMCs involved in the CEF formulations of the Gmfor this phase in the binary and the ternary systems. Specifically, we study the twelve EMCs corresponding to the following sublattice occupations: (Ni)1(Ni)1(In)1, which is usually described as Ni:Ni:In (i.e., a compound with formula "Ni2In"), Ni:Ni:Ni (i.e., "Ni3"), Ni:Ni:Sn ("Ni2Sn"), Ni:Va:In (i.e., "NiIn"), Ni:Va:Ni (i.e., "Ni2"), Ni:Va:Sn ("NiSn"), Va:Ni:In ("NiIn"), Va:Ni:Ni ("Ni2"), Va:Ni:Sn ("NiSn"), Va:Va:In ("In"), Va:Va:Ni ("Ni"), and Va:Va:Sn ("Sn"). For the listed EMCs, we report the lattice-parameters, the volume per atom, the electronic density of states and various types of cohesive properties usually taken as macroscopic manifestations of the bonding strength, viz., the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative, the cohesive energy and the energy of formation from the elements. Trends in these quantities are established as a function of the occupation of the various sublattices by the different components and discussed in terms of the interactions between d electrons of the transition element as well as the hybridization between them and the s and p electrons of the non-transition metal. In addition to the reported thermodynamic information of direct use as input in the CALPHAD optimizations, the picture of the variations in cohesive properties emerging from the present work should be useful in systematizing the thermophysical and structural database for this class of compounds.},

  abstract = {Noble/transition bimetallic nanowires of nominal composition Fe90Rh10 are AC electrodeposited into 20 nm diameter hexagonally self-assembled alumina nanopores. Nanowires about 18 nm in diameter and 1 μm long are polycrystalline and multiphase. Wires contain α-Fe grains and very small grains of the ClCs-type α′-Fe(Rh) phase. The room temperature magnetization mechanism and the thermal stability of nanowire magnetic configurations are further investigated by measuring the dependence of the coercive field on the applied field sweeping rate R. From these data a mean fluctuations field value of μ0HFR = (9.0 ± 0.5) mT is obtained (at coercivity) and an effective activation magnetic moment μac = 5400 μB is estimated, with μB the Bohr magneton. At the coercive field (about 45 mT) the resulting activation lengths become lAC ≈ 6.4 and 6.7 nm for α-Fe and α′-Fe(Rh), respectively. Assuming an effective magnetic anisotropy, considering magnetostatic shape contributions in addition to the magnetocrystalline one, the domain wall thickness δw in α-Fe grains and in the α′-Fe(Rh) become δwFe = 13.4 nm and δwFeRh = 10.9 nm respectively. These values are comparable to the activation lengths estimated at the coercive field in each phase. These facts strongly indicate that irreversible polarization reversal in these nanowires takes place by local curling, involving localized nucleation modes.},

  abstract = {The manufacture of alloys in solid state has many differences with the conventional melting (casting) process. In the case of high energy milling or mechanical alloying, phase transformations of the raw materials are promoted by a large amount of energy that is introduced by impact with the grinding medium; there is no melting, but the microstructural changes go from microstructural refinement to amorphization in solid state. This work studies the behavior of pure metals (Cu and Ni), and different binary alloys (Cu-Ni and Cu-Zr), under the same milling/mechanical alloying conditions. After high-energy milling, X ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were analyzed to determine changes in the lattice parameter and find both microstrain and crystallite sizes, which were first calculated using the Williamson-Hall (W-H) method and then compared with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. Calculations showed a relatively appropriate approach to observations with TEM; however, in general, TEM observations detect heterogeneities, which are not considered for the W-H method. As for results, in the set of pure metals, we show that pure nickel undergoes more microstrain deformations, and is more abrasive than copper (and copper alloys). In binary systems, there was a complete solid solution in the Cu-Ni system and a glass-forming ability for the Cu-Zr, as a function of the Zr content. Mathematical methods cannot be applied when the systems have amorphization because there are no equations representing this process during milling. A general conclusion suggests that, under the same milling conditions, results are very different due to the significant impact of the composition: nickel easily forms a solid solution, while with a higher zirconium content there is a higher degree of glass-forming ability.},

As in pure Zr, twinning, dislocations, hcp to fcc and hcp to bcc martensitic transformations near the crack tip are competing deformation mechanisms.

  abstract = {Cu-Al-Be single crystals show pseudoelasticity and the shape memory effect in a well-defined composition range. The β3-18R martensitic transition is the origin of these phenomena. The transformation temperatures and the critical stresses to induce the martensitic transition are affected by diffusive phenomena taking place both in the parent phase and in martensite. Pseudoelastic cycles were used to obtain quantitative data concerning the effect of diffusive phenomena like stabilization of martensite, ordering of the parent phase under load and recovery of this phase on the critical stresses to transform. Information was then obtained on changes in the relative phase stability. A model is presented to explain those changes taking place in the parent phase aged under load and in the martensitic 18R structure. Experimental data on the kinetics of diffusive phenomena is also presented and analyzed.},

  abstract = {Grain size has a strong effect on the pseudoelastic properties of shape-memory alloys. Different grain sizes and several related phenomena are studied. This involves the dependence of the transformation and retransformation stresses on grain size and on the amount of transformed material. A pronounced drop of transformation stresses on cycling is observed, until an asymptotic behavior is reached. This is related to the creation of defects (dislocations and dislocation arrays) and microplates of martensite, which are the defects necessary to allow the grains to accommodate due to the shape change imposed by the martensitic transformation. The asymptotic hysteresis is related to the internal work for the grains to accommodate each other once the necessary defects were created. The asymptotic hysteresis increases linearly as the grain size decreases. A simple model shows that the slope is related to the (d/. e) ratio, where d is the average grain size and e is the width of the specimen. This effect arises from the presence of the free surfaces that release the plastic work for grain accommodation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {CuAlBe shape memory alloys exhibit successive reversible stress induced martensitic transformations from austenite to 18R phase and from 18R to 6R phase. The particularities associated with these transformations result in CuAlBe being an attractive candidate material for damping applications. Recently, a stress-temperature phase transformation diagram has been proposed for this system, which, besides the above mentioned phases, also includes the structural distortion of the 18R previous to its stress induced transformation to 6R. In the present work, pseudoelastic cycling of CuAlBe single crystals has been performed at different test temperatures. Both transitions, i.e., austenite-18R and 18R-6R, have been studied. As hysteresis plays a significant role in shape-memory alloys intended to be used for energy dissipation, special attention has been devoted to its evolution during cycling. In addition, the kinetics of stabilization of martensites has been analyzed under dynamic (pseudoelastic cycling) and quasistatic (constant transformed fraction) conditions. A strong enhancement of martensitic stabilization under dynamic conditions compared with stabilization at quasistatic conditions was observed and the possible mechanisms responsible for the effect are mentioned.},

  abstract = {The pseudoelastic behavior of Cu-Al-Be single crystals shape memory alloys was analyzed in the temperature range from 303. K to 393. K. Tensile tests performed at slow crosshead speed show a dependence of the hysteresis associated to the stress induced β-18R transformation with temperature. The critical stresses of the β-18R transition have been determined giving a negative curvature parabolic dependence on temperature. The effect is more noticeable for the retransformation stress and a consequent increment in the stress hysteresis with temperature is observed. The deformation associated to the stress induced β-18R transition has also been found to depend on temperature. These singular features associated with the pseudoelastic behavior of Cu-Al-Be single crystals have been rationalized in terms of a structural distortion of the 18R martensite that has been found to occur in the considered temperature range. The strain associated to the structural distortion was determined as well as the dependence of its critical stress on temperature. The resulting entropy change was thus calculated, resulting fifty times smaller than the entropy change between the bcc parent phase and 18R. The possible mechanisms responsible of this structural distortion of the 18R structure are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Vanadium oxide nanotubes (NTs) were synthesized by the sol-gel method followed by a long-term hydrothermal treatment. The obtained nanotubes have a multiwall structure, and 70\% of vanadium ions are in the V 4+ state. This percentage was derived by evaluating three components of the magnetic susceptibility; namely, (i) the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior, (ii) antiferromagnetic dimers, and (iii) magnetic trimers. The as-made NTs were annealed in situ in the cavity of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The line shape changes irreversibly at 390 K, and the EPR susceptibility presents an anomaly at 425 K. These changes are interpreted as a partial oxidation of the V 4+ ions and consequently a decrease in the concentration of the magnetic species. The quantification of the V 4+ ions of the annealed NTs reveals a diminution to 39\% of V 4+, a weakening of the Curie-Weiss and antiferromagnetic dimers contributions, and the suppression of magnetic trimers. Vibrational studies confirm the decrease of V 4+ amount. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

The morphology of the NT’s has been characterized by transmission electron microscopy, while the metallic elements have been quantified by the instrumental neutron activation analysis technique. The static and dynamic magnetic properties were studied by collecting data of magnetization as a function of magnetic field and temperature and by electron paramagnetic resonance. At difference of the majority reports in the literature, we do not observe magnetic dimers in vanadium oxide nanotubes. Also, we observed that the incorporation of metallic ions (Co2þ, S¼3/2 and Ni2þ, S¼1) decreases notably the amount of V4þ ions in the system, from 1416\% (nondoped case) to 2\%4\%, with respect to the total vanadium atoms (fact corroborated by XPS experiments) anyway preserving the tubular nanostructure. The method to decrease the amount of V4þ in the nanotubes improves considerably their potential technological applications as Li-ion batteries cathodes.},

We have directly observed by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) that at a critical thickness dcr30nm the orientation of the magnetization in the magnetic domains changes from in-plane alignment to a system of stripes in which a component perpendicular to the film plane points alternately in opposite directions. The same critical thickness was also estimated from in-plane magnetization vs field measurements. From the MFM images we have also found that the stripe period is an increasing function of the film thickness following a square root law. These data were interpreted with two different models that yield parameters (magnetization, anisotropy, and exchange stiffness) compatible with those determined from magnetization measurements. Films with thicknesses above dcr show a strong dependence of the domain configuration on the magnetic history. Rotatable anisotropy was found in these samples, with a rotational anisotropy field that became stronger with the increase in film thickness. Bubblelike domains could be also observed when the sample is saturated perpendicular to the film plane. All magnetic measurements as a function of film thickness can be interpreted using the same values of magnetization, anisotropy, and exchange stiffness.},

The low temperature internal damping and dynamic elastic modulus exhibited a large heating-cooling hysteresis and two damping peaks: one due to a stress induced relaxation mechanism operating near 200 K [1 Hz] and another one, at about 260-270 K, which could not be correlated with any step in the modulus, indicating that it is not anelastic in origin. The high temperature damping was described by an exponential background and a broad peak contribution centered at about 400 K (1 Hz). The resulting maximum is frequency dependent, but it is little sensitive to applied fields up to 30 mT.

Several TEM techniques were used and HT-XRD experiments performed to determine the crystal structure and the morphological microstructure of the samples obtained during different heat treatments. The heat treatments were: quenching from 850 °C to room temperature and two consecutive calorimetric runs at 5 °C/min. After the quenching,α2is the major phase observed, reaching 95 mass\%. The remaining 5 mass\% consisted of martensitic phases: one sample had γ′, a hexagonal structure, and the other β1′, a rhombohedral structure. During the first calorimetric run, the sample containing the γ′ phase exhibited a calorimetric event and the sample containing the β1′ phase did not. The calorimetric event is attributed to the austenitic transformation γ′ → β1. The lack of calorimetric event in the sample containing the β1′ is associated with the inhibition of the transformation β1′ → β1because of the precipitation of the γ2phase. Finally, the absence of a calorimetric event in the second run with the first sample is associated with the retransformation to β1′ instead to γ′ phase during cooling of the first calorimetric run. These studies determined that the first sample is a better candidate than the second sample to produce a shape memory alloy after thermo-mechanical treatments of the milled powders.},

In the present study, the alternating current potential drop (ACPD) technique is used to analyze the change in electrical resistance of ultra-fine grained NiTi wires subjected to a broad range of thermo-mechanical load cases: (i) uniaxial tensile straining at constant temperatures (pseudoelastic deformation); (ii) cooling and heating through the transformation range at constant load (actuator load case); (iii) a combination of mechanical and thermal loading. We monitor the ACPD signals in several zones along the gauge length of specimens, and we demonstrate that a localized type of transformation is a generic feature of pseudoelastic as well as of shape memory deformation. Moreover, the ACPD signals allow to differentiate between temperature-induced martensite (formed during cooling at no or relatively small loads), stress-induced martensite, and reoriented martensite (formed under load at low temperatures).},

  abstract = {Cu-Zn-Al alloys have been produced by low energy ball milling following six different synthesis paths. In all cases, a mixture of α and β phases have been obtained. Milling for 100 h without interruptions the three elements simultaneously gave the best ratio between the amount of β phase and the milling time. Low temperature thermal treatments to the powders (up to 450 C) lead to γ phase crystallite growth, with the amount of β phase remaining nearly constant. With anneals at 800 C the β phase fraction in the powder increased solely to 86\%. A sample of pure β phase was obtained only after warm compaction at 680 MPa and sintering at temperatures above 800 C. In addition, it was necessary to reach temperatures of 900 C in order to have a material that transforms martensitically. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The formulations were named SPION-PEG350 and SPION-PEG2000. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements show that the SPIONs are near-spherical, well-crystalline, and have high saturation magnetization and susceptibility. FTIR spectroscopy identifies the presence of oleic acid and of the conjugates mPEG for each sample. In vitro biocompatibility of SPIONS was investigated using three cell lines; up to 100 μg/ml SPION-PEG350 showed non-toxicity, while SPION-PEG2000 showed no signal of toxicity even up to 200 μg/ml. The uptake of SPIONS was detected using magnetization measurement, confocal and atomic force microscopy. SPION-PEG2000 presented the highest internalization capacity, which should be correlated with the mPEG chain size. The in vivo results suggested that SPION-PEG2000 administration in mice triggered liver and kidney injury.},

  abstract = {We have used oxygen ions irradiation to generate controlled structural disorder in thin manganite films. Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and transport and magnetic measurements were performed to analyze the influence of the implantation process in the physical properties of the films. CAFM images show regions with different conductivity values, probably due to the random distribution of point defect. The transport and magnetic properties of these systems are interpreted in this context. Metal-insulator transition can be described in the frame of a percolative model. Disorder increases the distance between conducting regions, lowering the observed TMI. Point-defect disorder increases localization of the carriers due to increased disorder and locally enhanced strain field. Remarkably, even with the inhomogeneous nature of the samples, no sign of low-field magnetoresistance was found. Point-defect disorder decreases the system magnetization but does not seem to change the magnetic transition temperature. The coercive field of the samples increases linearly with increasing disorder but decreases when disorder is higher than a critical value.},

However, due to its brittle-ness to obtain wires, a metallic sheath is needed for drawing. In the present work, grade 2 titanium has been used as sheath material, and several multifilamentary wires have been prepared. The powder-in-tube method has been used to prepare the wires with the in situ variant, where the sheath is filled with the unreacted precursor powders (Mg and B). Different thermal treatments have been investigated including several intermediate treatments during the drawing process in addition to the final one. This last treatment is necessary to accomplish the synthesis and heal the cracks generated during the cold work. The superconducting properties were determined by magnetiza-tion measurements on a SQUID magnetometer, and the microstructure evolution was followed by TEM and SEM microscopy. Mechanical behavior is also evaluated.},

  abstract = {A Focused Ion Beam (FIB)/lift-out technique was used to prepare site-specific thin samples of the cathode/electrolyte interface of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC) materials. The cathode under study was a nanostructured perovskite of composition La0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ(LSCF) deposited by spin coating on a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ(CGO) supporting substrate. We compared the results for a 15 μm and a 5 μm thickness cathode layers, before and after a thermal treatment of 1000 h at 500 °C, with the aim of simulating operation conditions. Both, Transmission (TEM) and Scanning (SEM) Electron Microscopy, coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) systems, were used to characterize the composition and nanostructure at both sides of the cathode/electrolyte interface. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a semi-coherent interface between LSCF and CGO was observed by Electron Diffraction as well as by High Resolution TEM in many points at the interfacial boundary. A large difference in total contact area was observed between the thickest and the thinnest cathode layers, despite they present the same composition and nano sized structure. The real contact area in the 5 μm cathode sample is around 50\% less than in the 15 μm sample due to the presence of pores at the interface. This observation may partially explain the difference in resistivity observed for these two half cells assemblies. On the other side, no differences were found comparing composition and nanostructure at the interface before and after the thermal treatment. Thus, this study becomes fundamental to understand the role played by the interface for improving the performance of IT-SOFC under long time operation conditions: a necessary premise for its real application. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy on the FIB foils combined with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) allowed the characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interphases and the determination of its influence on the cell performance after long-term operation conditions. This work reviews two cases: on one hand, Ln2NiO4+d (Ln= La, Nd) cathodes deposited on both Y0.08Zr0.92O1.96 and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes, that react at 900 °C during the adhesion treatment and at temperatures higher than 650 °C during the EIS measurements. These samples present a reaction layer of 10 nm thickness, which contains elements of both phases and was found responsible of the cell performance degradation. On the other hand, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathodes showed excelent performance on Ceria electrolytes, even after 1 000 h at operation conditions. In that case, the microscopic analyses of FIB foils showed a semi-coherent interphase growth.}

Debris consisted in agglomerations of nano-crystalline oxide particles sized between 5 and 20 nm. The crystal structure of debris was found to depend on the displacement amplitude.

  abstract = {A 1-D thermomechanical model aimed to represent the behavior of Ni-rich ultrafine grained NiTi wires upon pseudoelastic cycling was developed. The three more significant features associated to the pseudoelastic behavior of NiTi wires were taken into consideration for its formulation. These are: the localized character of the stress induced transformation which is accompanied by the nucleation and propagation of a discrete number of transformation fronts; the thermal effects associated with the heat of transformation and the Clausius-Clapeyron type of dependence of critical stresses with temperature; the functional fatigue effects resulting in the decrease of critical stresses and the accumulation of permanent deformation during cycling. The model assesses the mechanical response by evaluating the local conditions at the different moving interfaces that might be present at a certain time. It was implemented in MATLAB and numerical simulations have been found to exhibit good agreement with experimental results obtained under similar conditions. It is therefore considered that the model here proposed constitutes a good conceptualization of the complex pseudoelastic behavior of NiTi wires that allows reproducing the fundamental aspects of actual observed behaviors},

  abstract = {The fabrication of engineered lattice structures has recently gained momentum due to the development of novel additive manufacturing techniques. Interest in lattice structures resides not only in the possibility of obtaining efficient lightweight materials, but also in the functionality of pre-designed architectured structures for specific applications, such as biomimetic implants, chemical catalyzers, and heat transfer devices. The mechanical behaviour of lattice structures depends not only the composition of the base material, but also on the type and size of the unit cells, as well as on the material microstructure resulting from a specific fabrication procedure. The present work focuses on the static and fatigue behavior of diamond cell lattice structures fabricated from an AlSiMg alloy by laser powder bed fusion technology. In particular, the specimens were fabricated with three different orientations of lattice cells—[001], [011], [111]—and subjected to static tensile testing and force-controlled pull–pull fatigue testing up to 1 × 107 cycles. In parallel, the mechanical behavior of dense tensile plain and notched specimens was also studied and compared to that of their lattice counterparts. Results showed a significant effect of the cell orientation on the fatigue lives: specimens oriented at [001] were \textasciitilde 30\% more fatigue-resistant than specimens oriented at [011] and [111].},

Simulations were carried out modifying the wires length and the structural mass. Both parameters were varied over two orders of magnitude with the aim of evaluating the type of response, the mitigation level that can be accomplished and the combination of parameters resulting in an optimal response. Results indicate that the proposed device is suitable for seismic protection of isolated structures and it is demonstrated that the protective action is more related with the restraining and self-centering properties of the NiTi superelastic wires than with its damping capacity.},

  abstract = {The hysteretic damping capacity and high recoverable strains characterizing the superelastic response of shape memory alloys (SMA) make these materials attractive for protection systems of structures subjected to dynamic loads. A successful implementation however is conditioned by functional fatigue exhibited by the SMA when subjected to cyclic loading. The residual deformation upon cycling and the efficiency in material usage are the two most restrictive issues in this sense. In this paper, a device equipped with superelastic NiTi SMA wires and capable of supporting external tension compression loads with optimized properties is presented. It is shown how the introduction of the wires' pre-straining allows for the absorption of deleterious residual deformation without affecting the self-centering capabilities upon unloading, in contrast with what occurs for pre-strained tendons. These features were experimentally verified in an in-scale prototype composed of two 1.2 mm diameter superelastic NiTi SMA wires. In order to numerically assess the dynamic response of a simple structure subjected to seismic excitations, a multilinear superelasticity model for the NiTi wires was developed. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The cable oscillations are induced by wind, rain or traffic. The SMA and their solid-solid phase transformation permits effective damping via the hysteresis cycle and the conversion of mechanical work in heat. The analysis of SMA behavior needs to be strictly coherent with the requirements associated to the application. In particular, the high requirement on working cycles induced by a strong storm of 3 or 4 days, the temperature – stress dependence of the phase transformation (via Clausius-Clapeyron equation), the self-heating effects, the SMA creep and the eventual effects of aging (temperature and time) on the transformation temperatures (i.e., atomic order and/or other effects) were studied. The SMA was applied to mitigate the oscillations induced in realistic cables in ELSA (45 m length) with positive results, and in the LCPC facility (50 m length), always with equivalent simulation tests. The experimental examples suggest that the SMA permit an effective reduction of the oscillation amplitudes better than a half. The work is realized in the frame of SMARTeR, one S3T-ESF project their goal is the damping in stayed cables of bridges. For instance, the Iroise bridge in the highway between Brest and Plougastel, France, or eventually in the St. Nazaire bridge in the “Loire Atlantique” near Nantes or other bridges (i.e. the “Viaducs du Boulonnais” in the A16 highway, France).},

  abstract = {The use of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) in technical applications as damping in civil engineering structures requires the characterization of the alloy for each specific application. This involves the evolution of the mechanical properties and damping capacity with the number of cycles, frequency, maximum deformation, applied stresses, and the evolution of the alloy with aging time and temperature. In particular, the temperature effects associated to self-heating need to be evaluated. In continuous cycling the effects of latent heat, the associated dissipation induced by the hysteresis, the heat flow to surroundings and the cycling frequency induce different states of temperature in the specimen, which in turn produces changes in the transformation-retransformation stresses. In this article, the temperature effects associated to cycling are outlined for different cycling frequencies. The results show that, for relatively faster frequency the temperature arrives at an oscillatory state superimposed to an exponential increase. For lower frequencies, some parts of the sample attain temperatures below room temperature. The experimental results are represented with an elementary model (the 1-body model or the Tian equation used in calorimetric representation) of heat transfer. For the higher fracture where life requirements are associated to damping in stayed cables for bridges, the results show (for the NiTi alloy) a reduction of the hysteresis width as the frequency increases for deformations up to 8\%. For reduced deformation, under 2\% appears an asymptotic behavior where the frictional area is practically independent of the cycling frequency (up to 20 Hz). In addition, it is shown that more than 4 million of working cycles can be attained if the maximum applied stress is kept below a threshold of about 200 MPa. Although under this condition the deformation must remain lower than 2\% a reasonable damping capacity can still be obtained.},

  abstract = {Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are good candidates for solid-state dampers appropriate for the oscillations of bridge stay cables because of their large recoverable strain, hysteresis and reasonable fatigue-life. This work experimentally analyzes the relevant properties of NiTi SMA and conducts facility measurements, frequency analyzes and simulations of the effects of SMA on stay cables. Appropriate phenomenological SMA models were developed and included in a Finite Element (FE) simulation environment. A complete damping solution for bridge stay cables was developed from these experimental analyzes. This paper detail the required properties for a NiTi SMA and analyzes their performance. For instance, the fatigue-life and several of the thermo-mechanical effects influencing the application of NiTi SMAs are outlined. The damping effect of the SMA was studied in two facilities. The first series of measurements was performed using cable 1 of the ELSA facility (JRC-EU, Ispra, Italy). The second was completed in two campaigns at IFSTTAR (Bouguenais, near Nantes in France). The numeric analyzes and simulated results were completely coherent with these experiments: the SMA dampers also drastically reduce the maximum oscillation amplitude induced by the simulated action. The frequency evolution of the damped cable was studied using direct calculations on the signals, the windowed Fourier transform and Morlet wavelets. © 2012.},

  abstract = {The transformation and retransformation paths realized at constant stress in wires of NiTi SMAs show a horizontal or ‘‘flat’’ behavior in the hysteretic cycle. After sinusoidal cycling at 0.01 Hz (i.e., training) with a maxi- mal strain of 8 \%, the thicker wires of NiTi SMAs, with a diameter of 2.46 mm, have the stress–strain cycles with one S-shaped behavior. A ‘‘similar’’ change appears by varying the grain sizes in the samples, i.e., from 80 to 20 nm. Furthermore, the local measurements of tempera- ture suggest that cycling induces changes in the transfor- mation mechanisms associated with the evolution from horizontal to S shape. For instance, the associated energy evolves from localized transformation to homogeneous heat production in S-shaped cycles. Thermodynamic analysis establishes a link between heat capacity and the slopes of the coexistence curve in f–x or in r–e via the (qe/ qr)coex. The flat cycles were coherent with the classical latent heat, i.e., dissipation at constant stress. In the S-shaped cycles, the heat during the phase change seems redistributed as heat capacity against progressive stress. Preliminary direct measurements are coherent with the evolution of the (qe/qr)coex against strain.},

A few major examples are outlined in the present study. First, the elementary reason for thermoelasticity and pseudoelasticity in single crystals of Cu–Zn–Al (b-18R transformation) arises from the interaction of a growing martensite plate with the existing dislocations in the material. Secondly, in Cu–Al–Ni, the twinned hexagonal (c0) martensite produces dislocations inhibiting this transformation and favoring the appearance of 18R in subsequent transformation cycles. Thirdly, single crystals of Cu–Al–Be visualize, via enhanced stress, a transformation primarily to 18R, a structural distortion of the 18R structure, and an additional transformation to another martensitic phase (i.e., 6R) with an increased strain. A dynamic behavior in Ni–Ti is also analyzed, where defects alter the pseudoelastic behavior after cycling. Keywords},

At higher temperature phase or at lower stress the austenite is the metastable phase. The martensite appears at lower temperature phase or higher stresses. The hysteresis of the transformation permits different levels of applications, i.e., in their use as a damper. Two types of applications can be considered in damping of structures in Civil Engineering. The first one is related to diminishing the damage induced by earthquakes. The second one is a reduction of oscillation amplitude associate to an increase of the lifetime for the stayed cables in bridges.

Experimental results show that MCo co-milled 50 h plus admixed MWCNTs for 5 h exhibits enhanced absorption/desorption performance, which remains stable after 15 hydrogen sorption cycles. About 6.5 wt\% of hydrogen was absorbed after 100 s and desorbed in 85 min at 250 °C, being one of the best conditions reported for Mg-based composites. Furthermore, desorption temperature after cycling was reduced by 55 °C due to the introduction of Co, and 136 °C by the combined Co and MWCNT addition as compared to free MgH2. Activation energy analysis demonstrates that although the MWCNT addition has a slight influence on the energy barrier, the Co particles show a good catalytic effect. Moreover, the coupled effect of Co and MWCNTs reduces the activation energy and it is maintained after cycling. As a consequence of cycling, some nanograins of MgH2appear covered with a thin external layer of amorphous carbon while some part of the MWCNTs remains intact in the material. An interpretation of the kinetics effect of Co particles and MWCNT coupled addition is proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The effects of the alloy composition, the nanowire diameter and the grain size on the hysteresis properties are considered. X-ray diffraction indicates that the nanowires are single phase, a fcc Co-Pd solid solution; electron microscopy results show that they are polycrystalline, with randomly oriented grains (7-12 nm), smaller than the wire diameter. Nanowire arrays are ferromagnetic, with an easy magnetization axis parallel to the nanowire long axis. Both, the coercive field and the loop squareness monotonously increase with the Co content and with the grain size, but no clear correlation with the wire diameter is found. The Co and Co-rich nanowire arrays exhibit coercive fields and reduced remanence values quite insensitive to temperature in the range 4 K-300 K; on the contrary, in Pd-rich nanowires both magnitudes are smaller and they largely increase during cooling below 100 K. These behaviors are systematized by considering the strong dependences displayed by the magneto-crystalline anisotropy and the saturation magnetostriction on composition and temperature. At low temperatures the effective anisotropy value and the domain-wall width to grain size ratio drastically change, promoting less cooperative and harder nucleation modes.},

  abstract = {ZnO-core/CoFe2O4-shell nanoparticles of 7.4 nm average size have been synthesized and their magnetic properties have been compared to those of CoO-core/CoFe2O4-shell nanoparticles with similar morphology. The coercive field values are much lower than those for CoO/CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (e.g., at 5 K: Hc = 7.8 kOe for ZnO/CoFe2O4; Hc = 27.8 kOe for CoO/CoFe2O4). The nature of the coercive field values is explained by a phenomenological model for the free energy of a non-magnetic core, or an antiferromagnetic core, encapsulated by a hard ferrimagnetic shell. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a nanoparticle-mesoporous oxide thin film composite (NP-MOTF) as low-cost and straightforward sensing platforms for surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Titania, zirconia, and silica mesoporous matrices templated with Pluronics F-127 were synthesized via evaporation-induced self-assembly and loaded with homogeneously dispersed Ag nanoparticles by soft reduction or photoreduction. Both methods give rise to uniform and reproducible Raman signals using 4-mercaptopyridine as a probe molecule. Details on stability and reproducibility of the Raman enhancement are discussed. Extensions in the design of these composite structures were explored including detection of nonthiolated molecules, such as rhodamine 6-G or salicylic acid, patterning techniques for locating the enhancement regions and bilayered mesoporous structures to provide additional control on the environment, and potential size-selective filtration. These inorganic oxide-metal composites stand as extremely simple, reproducible, and versatile platforms for Raman spectroscopy analysis.},

We synthesize PtIrO{$<$}inf{$>$}x{$<$}/inf{$>$}/C electrocatalysts of different atomic compositions dispersed on Carbon Vulcan XC-72R® by using the fast polyol method assisted by microwaves. Afterwards, PtIrO{$<$}inf{$>$}x{$<$}/inf{$>$}/C was potentiodynamically decorated by Rh (Rh/PtIrO{$<$}inf{$>$}x{$<$}/inf{$>$}/C). The NPs are characterized by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrooxidation of glycerol was investigated in acid medium by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrochemical stability of Rh/PtIrO{$<$}inf{$>$}x{$<$}/inf{$>$}/C NPs was evaluated by following a degradation test protocol, which consists in exhaustive cyclic voltammetries. Our results show that the presence of iridium oxides in the architecture of platinum enhances the electrochemical stability of the catalyst by avoiding agglomeration effects. Moreover, the presence of rhodium catalyzes the glycerol electrooxidation reaction. These results help understanding the role of Rh and IrO{$<$}inf{$>$}x{$<$}/inf{$>$} in the glycerol electrooxidation and provide new insights for designing nanomaterials with improved stability and activity.},

  abstract = {The effects of high dose ion irradiation in β Cu-Zn-Al were investigated between room temperature and 150 °C. Single crystal samples with surface normal close to [001]βwere irradiated with 300 keV Cu+ions. Microstructural changes were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Irradiation induced cavities located on the surface exposed to the irradiation were observed. The morphology, size and density distribution of these cavities were analyzed as a function of different irradiation conditions. The shape and location of the cavities with respect to the irradiation surface were not affected by irradiation temperature or irradiation dose. Instead, the cavity size distribution showed a bi-modal shape for a dose of 15 dpa, regardless of irradiation temperature. For a dose of 30 dpa the bi-modal distribution was only observed after room temperature irradiation. The diffusion effects of vacancies produced by irradiation are analyzed in shape memory Cu-Zn-Al alloys, which main characteristic is the diffusionless martensitic transformation. Particularly, the cavity size distributions were analyzed in terms of nucleation, growth and coalescence. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This thinning method was compared with conventional electropolishing and Ar(+) ion milling. No implanted Ga was detected but surface FCC precipitation was found as a result of the focused ion beam sample preparation. Decreasing the irradiation dose by lowering the energy and current of the Ga(+) ions did not lead to a complete disappearance of the FCC structure. The latter could only be removed after gentle Ar(+) ion milling of the sample. It was further concluded that the precipitation of the FCC is independent of the crystallographic orientation of the surface.},

For metallic systems (conducting sample), it is expected that the greatest contribution to the damage comes from knock-on displacement, but radiolysis is the most probable radiation damage mechanism for organic samples. The radiation damage of the electron beam produces huge changes in AuNPs’ structure, leading to coalescence of the Au cores when their \{100\} surfaces are facing each other. The complete coalescence process involve thiol desoprtion, AuNPs’ reorientation, and surface diffusion of Au adatoms, which produce the oriented attachment of the Au cores. The knock-on displacement cannot explain by itself the time taken by the entire process. Through a rigorous analysis, we rationalize the results considering that because of the small size of AuNPs they have a lower electron density than the bulk material which favors radiolytic damage.},

Indeed, the 3-mercaptopropanoic acid (MPA) and its ester or amide derivatives are widely used for SAM-based sensor design. It was already shown that MPA does not suffer C–S bond scission when adsorbed on Au. On the other hand, in this work we demonstrate that its simplest derivative, methyl 3-mercapto propionate (Me-MPA), is prone to form significant amounts of atomic sulfur when adsorbed on Au. The MPA derivatives are more sensible than MPA itself to alkaline solutions, and its SAM-based sensors will rapidly degrade given atomic sulfur. In this work, we study the simplest MPA derivative Me-MPA SAMs on preferentially oriented Au(111) surfaces by XPS and electrochemical measurements. It was found that the desulfuration of Me-MPA depends on its preparation conditions (grown from ethanol or toluene solution) and on its post-treatment with alkaline solution. In order},

Platinum or silver nanoparticles with diameters dn = 4.9 nm (ds = 4.9 nm; dv/dn = 1.05) or dn = 8.0 nm (ds = 10.6 nm; dv/dn = 1.63), respectively, were observed by TEM on the surface of the protein/polymer supports. Both nanocatalysts showed excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of p-nitro­ phenol with NaBH4 at room temperature, with conversions of 100\% and 97\% for platinum and silver bio­ nanocatalysts, respectively. Noteworthy, both bionanocatalysts maintain their activity until 4 reuse cycles, being the platinum-based system the one showing the best performance. These results demonstrated that the developed bionanocatalysts are promising and emerging alternatives in the field of supported noble metal nanoparticlebased heterogeneous catalysts.},

          , 
            Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a noninvasive treatment for cancer relying on the incorporation of NIR-light absorbing nanomaterials into cells, which upon illumination release heat causing thermally induced cell death. We prove that irradiation of aqueous suspensions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-coated silver nanoplates (PVPAgNP) or PVPAgNP in HeLa cells with red or NIR lasers causes a sizeable photothermal effect, which in cells can be visualized with the temperature sensing fluorophore Rhodamine B (RhB) using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence lifetime imaging. Upon red-light irradiation of cells that were incubated with both, RhB and PVPAgNP at concentrations with no adverse effects on cell viability, a substantial heat release is detected. Initiation of cell death by photothermal effect is observed by positive signals of fluorescent markers for early and late apoptosis. Surprisingly, a new nanomaterial-assisted cell killing mode is operating when PVPAgNP-loaded HeLa cells are excited with moderate powers of fs-pulsed NIR light. Small roundish areas are generated with bright and fast ({\textless}1 ns) decaying emission, which expand fast and destroy the whole cell in seconds. This characteristic emission is assigned to efficient optical breakdown initiation around the strongly absorbing PVPAgNP leading to plasma formation that spreads fast through the cell.},

	abstract = {Amphiphilic comb polymers, like poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAO), are frequently used to transfer hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) into aqueous media. While it is accepted that the hydro­ philization is based on the interdigitation of the hydrocarbon chains from the polymer and the NP capping, the factors that determine the success of such process are still not fully understood. In this paper, some key aspects of the formation of water-soluble NP-PMAO assemblies from oleate-capped iron oxide NPs, not considered in previous works, are discussed thoroughly. We have found that the process is notably hindered when the chemisorbed oleates coverage decreases from 2.9 to 1.5 molecules/nm2, revealing the importance of the capping packing density in the assembly mechanism. Combined results from small-angle x-ray scattering and electron microscopy show that, for polymer concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 monomer units/nm2, the NPs are individually covered by polymer chains, although forming rather planar NP-PMAO assemblies which contain several NPs. Both the minimum polymer concentration needed for a successful hydrophilization (0.7 gPMAO/L) and the geometry of the assemblies suggest that intermolecular structures typical of comb polymers act as templates in the assembly process. Finally, we show that the magnetic properties are modulated by the polymer loading.},

This study is motivated by the lack of mechanistic explanations of the oriented attachment of n-dodecanethiolateprotected nanoparticles exposed to irradiation during imaging by transmission electron microscopy. The coalescence of these nanoparticles preferentially occurs through the encounter of the (100) faces. It could be hypothesized that thiolate desorption from the Au(100) faces is faster than that on Au(111), which would overcome the steric hindrance for the encounter of the (100) metallic surfaces. Nevertheless, we found that the organic material desorbs at comparable rates and extension from both singlecrystalline surfaces, despite the fact that the most abundant damaging products are diﬀerent on these surfaces. Furthermore, although RS−R′ prevails on Au(111) while RS−SR is formed on Au(100), complete moieties derived from dodecanethiolate are the main desorption products from both SAMs. In addition, we provided arguments based on the reaction mechanism to describe the crosslinking of hydrocarbon chains and to explain why sulfur-containing species desorbs at the same rate from both single-crystalline surfaces.},

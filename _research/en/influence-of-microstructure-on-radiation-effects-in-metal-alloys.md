The influence of the microstructure of metal alloys on damages generated by ion irradiation is studied. The objective is to establish the damage mechanisms and ways to mitigate them through the design of an appropriate microstructure, in order to conceptually contribute to the development of alloys with high resistance to irradiation for applications in fission or fusion reactors. Currently, this line of research is being developed in collaboration with Dr. Esteban Sánchez from the Surface Physics Division of the Bariloche Atomic Center.

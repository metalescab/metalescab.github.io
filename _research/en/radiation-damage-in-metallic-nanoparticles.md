Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) are of great interest in various fields of basic and applied science. This interest is largely due to the fact that the physicochemical properties at the macroscopic scale depend on the size, shape, and composition of these MNPs. Therefore, when preparing such nanomaterials, it is essential to have adequate comprehensive characterization of the structure and composition. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a fundamental tool in the characterization process.

However, since nanoparticles behave differently from the bulk material, it is expected that they also behave differently under irradiation.

The electron beam of the TEM excites the electrons of the sample, which can generate chemical changes in the irradiated materials. These changes may involve desorption of surface molecules, diffusion of surface atoms and molecules, and even coalescence of metallic cores. This coalescence of NPs occurs when the crystal faces are properly oriented (Oriented Attachment).
